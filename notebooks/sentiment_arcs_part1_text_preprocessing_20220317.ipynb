Virtually all long text contains narrative elements...(TODO: Insert excerpts from Paper Abstract/Intro Sections here)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **SentimentArcs: Cloning the Github repository to your gDrive**\n","\n","If this is the first time using SentimentArcs, you will need to copy the software from our Github.com repository (github repo). The default recommended gDrive path is ./gdrive/MyDrive/research/sentiment_arcs/'. \n","\n","The first time you run this notebook and connect your Google gDrive, it will allow to to specify the path to your SentimentArcs subdirectory. If it does not exists, this notebook will copy/clone the SentimentArcs github repository code to your gDrive at the path you specify.\n","\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **NovelText: A Reference Corpus of 24 Diverse Novel**\n","\n","Sentiment Arcs comes with a carefully curated reference corpus of Novels to illustrate the unique diachronic sentiment analysis characteristic of long form fictional narrativeas. This corpus of 24 diverse novels also provides a baseline for exploring and comparing new novels with sentiment analysis using SentimentArcs.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Preparing New Novels: Formatting and adding to subdirectory**\n","\n","To analyze new novels with SentimentArcs, the body of the text should consist of plain text organized in to blocks separated by two newlines which visually look like a single blank line between blocks. These blocks are usually paragraphs but can also include title headers, separate lines of dialog or quotes. Please reference any of the 24 novels in the NovelText corpus for examples of this expected format.\n","\n","Once the new novel is correctly formatted as a plain text file, it should follow this standard file naming convention:\n","\n","[first letter of first name]+[full lastname]_[abbreviated book title].txt\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","* fdouglass_narrativelifeofaslave\n","* fscottfitzgerald_thegreatgatsby.txt\n","* vwoolf_mrsdalloway.txt\n","* homer-ewilson_odyssey.txt (trans. E.Wilson)\n","* mproust-mtreharne_3guermantesway.txt (Book 3, trans. M.Treharne)\n","* staugustine_confessions9end.txt (Upto and incl Book 9)\n","\n","Note the optional author suffix (-translator) and optional title suffix (-selected chapters/books)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Adding New Novels: Add file to subdirectory and Update this Notebook**\n","\n","Once you have a cleaned and text file named according the standard rule above, you must move that file to the subdirectory of all input novels and update the global variable in this notebook that defines which novels to analyze.\n","\n","First, copy your cleaned text file to the subdirectory containing all novels read by this notebook. This subdir is defined by the program variable 'subdir_novels' with the default value './in1_novels/'\n","\n","Second, update the program variable 'novels_dt'. This is a Dictionary data structure that following the pattern below:\n","```\n","novels_dt = {\n","  'cdickens_achristmascarol':['A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ',1843,1399],\n","```\n","Where the first string (the dictionary key) must match the filename root without the '.txt' suffix (e.g. cdickens_achristmascarol). The Dictionary value after the ':' is a list of three elements:\n","\n","* A nicely formatted string of the form '(title) by (full first and last name of author)' that should be a human friendly string used to label plots and saved files.\n","\n","* The (publication year) and the (sentence count). Both are optional, but should have placeholder string '0' if unknown. These are intended for future reference and analytics.\n","\n","* Your future self will thank you if you insert new novels into the 'novels_dt' in alphabetic order for faster and more accurate reference.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **How to Execute SentimentArcs Notebooks:**\n","\n","This is a Jupyter Notebook created to run on Google's free Colab service using only a browers and your exiting Google email account. We chose Google Colab because it is relatively, fast, free, easy to use and makes collaboration as simple as web browsing.\n","\n","A few reminders about using Jupyter Notebooks general and SentimentArcs in particular:\n","\n","* All cells must be run ***in order*** as later code cells often depend upon the output of earlier code cells\n","\n","* ***Cells that take more time to execute*** (> 1 min) usually begin with *%%time* which outputs the *total execution time* of the last run.  This timing output is deleted and recalculated each time the code cell is executed.\n","\n","* **[OPTIONAL]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* change a setting in that cell to customize behavior.\n","\n","* **[CUSTOMIZE]** at the top of a cell indicates you *must* change a setting in that cell.\n","\n","* **[RESTART REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* see a *[RESTART REQUIRED] button* at the end of the output. *If you see this button, you must select [Runtime]->[Restart Runtime] from the top menubar.\n","\n","* **[INPUT REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you will be required to take some action for execution to proceed, usually by clicking a button or entering the response to a prompt.\n","\n","All cells with a top comment prefixed with # [OPTIONAL]: indicates that you can change a setting to customize behavior, the prefix [CUSTOMIZE] indicates you MUST set/change a setting\n","\n","* SentimentArcs divides workflow into a series of chronological Jupyter Notebooks that must be run in order. Here is an overview of the workflow:\n","\n","***\n","\n","**SentimentArcs Notebooks Workflow**\n","1. Notebook #1: Preprocess Text\n","2. Notebook #2: Compute Sentiment Values (Simple Models/CPUs)\n","3. Notebook #3: Compute Sentiment Values (Complex Models/GPUs)\n","4. Notebook #4: Combine all Sentiment Values, perform Time Series analysis, and extract Crux points and surrounding text\n","\n","If you are unfamilar with setting up and using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, here are a series of resources to quickly bring you up to speed. If you are using SentimentArcs with the Cambridge University Press Elements textbook, there are also a series of videos by Prof Elkins and Chun stepping you through these

cycling.\n","Processing asent: Now Dan understood what she meant.\n","Processing asent: The one in the fishing shirt is doing it, too, Dave Stone said.\n","Processing asent: His voice was only slightly shaky, and Dan guessed he knew where some of his daughters steel had come from.\n","Processing asent: But he didnt have time to think about that now.\n","Processing asent: Abra was telling him they hadnt gotten the whole crew.\n","Processing asent: He sprinted to the Winnebago.\n","Processing asent: The door was still open.\n","Processing asent: He ran up the steps, threw himself on the carpeted floor, and managed to bang his head hard enough on the post under the eating table to send bright specks shooting across his field of vision.\n","Processing asent: Never happens that way in the movies, he thought, and rolled over, expecting to be shot or stomped or injected by the one who had stayed behind to provide the rearguard.\n","Processing asent: The one Abra called the crow.\n","Processing asent: They werent totally stupid and complacent after all, it seemed.\n","Processing asent: The Winnebago was empty.\n","Processing asent: Appeared empty.\n","Processing asent: Dan got to his feet and hurried through the kitchenette.\n","Processing asent: He passed a foldout bed, rumpled from frequent occupancy.\n","Processing asent: Part of his mind registered the fact that the RV smelled like the wrath of God in spite of the air-conditioner that was still running.\n","Processing asent: There was a closet, but the door stood open on its track and he saw nothing inside but clothes.\n","Processing asent: He bent, looking for feet.\n","Processing asent: No feet.\n","Processing asent: He went on to the rear of the Winnebago and stood beside the bathroom door.\n","Processing asent: He thought more movie shit, and pulled it open, crouching as he did it.\n","Processing asent: The Winnebagos can was empty, and he wasnt surprised.\n","Processing asent: If

asent: Abra came back at once, full of panic, broadcasting so powerfully that she scattered his own thoughts.\n","Processing asent: (no Barrys the one who died WHERES THE CROW FIND THE CROW)\n","Processing asent: Dan left the RV.\n","Processing asent: Both of the men who had come after Abra were gone; only their clothes were left.\n","Processing asent: The womanthe one who had tried to send him to sleepwas still there, but wouldnt be for long.\n","Processing asent: She had crawled to the picnic table with the ruined wicker basket on it and now lay propped against one of the bench seats, staring at Dan, John, and Dave from her newly crooked face.\n","Processing asent: Blood ran from her nose and mouth, giving her a red goatee.\n","Processing asent: The front of her blouse was soaked.\n","Processing asent: As Dan approached, her skin melted from her face and her clothes fell inward against the strutwork of her skeleton.\n","Processing asent: No longer held in place by her shoulders, the straps of her bra flopped in loops.\n","Processing asent: Of her soft parts, only her eyes remained, watching Dan.\n","Processing asent: Then her skin reknit itself and her clothes plumped up around her body.\n","Processing asent: The fallen bra straps bit into her upper arms, the strap on the left gagging the rattlesnake so it couldnt bite.\n","Processing asent: The fingerbones clutching her shattered jaw grew a hand.\n","Processing asent: You fucked us, Snakebite Andi said.\n","Processing asent: Her voice was slurred.\n","Processing asent: Fucked by a bunch of rubes.\n","Processing asent: I dont believe it.\n","Processing asent: Dan pointed at Dave.\n","Processing asent: That rube there is the father of the girl you came to kidnap.\n","Processing asent: Just in case youre wondering.\n","Processing asent: Snake managed a painful grin.\n","Processing asent: Her teeth were rimmed with blood.\n","Processing asent: You think I give a tin

had been found, by a goddess with a thundercloud of dark hair.\n","Processing asent: Now she was dying, and she wouldnt have changed a thing.\n","Processing asent: The years between the ex-actor president and the black president had been good; that one magic night with Rose had been even better.\n","Processing asent: She grinned brightly up at the tall good-looking one.\n","Processing asent: It hurt to grin, but she did it, anyway.\n","Processing asent: Oh, him.\n","Processing asent: Hes in Reno.\n","Processing asent: Fucking rube showgirls.\n","Processing asent: She began to disappear again.\n","Processing asent: Dan heard John Dalton whisper, Oh my God, look at that.\n","Processing asent: Brain bleed.\n","Processing asent: I can actually see it.\n","Processing asent: Dan waited to see if Tat Woman would come back.\n","Processing asent: Eventually she did, with a long groan from between her clenched and bloody teeth.\n","Processing asent: The cycling seemed to hurt even more than the blow that had caused it, but Dan thought he could remedy that.\n","Processing asent: He pulled Tat Womans hand away from her shattered jaw and dug in with his fingers.\n","Processing asent: He could feel her entire skull shift as he did; it was like pushing the side of a badly cracked vase held together by a few strips of tape.\n","Processing asent: This time Tat Woman did more than groan.\n","Processing asent: She howled and pawed weakly at Dan, who paid no attention.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Crow?\n","Processing asent: Anniston!\n","Processing asent: Snake screamed.\n","Processing asent: He got off in Anniston!\n","Processing asent: Please dont hurt me anymore, Daddy!\n","Processing asent: Please dont, Ill do whatever you want!\n","Processing asent: Dan thought of what Abra said these monsters had done to Brad Trevor in Iowa, how they had tortured him and God only knew how many others, and felt an almost ungovernable urge to tear the lower half of this murdering bitchs face entirely off.\n","Processing asent: To beat her bleeding, shattered skull with her own jawbone until both skull and bone disappeared.\n","Processing asent: Thenabsurdly, given the circumstanceshe thought of the kid in the Braves t-shirt reaching for the left-over coke piled on the shiny magazine cover.\n","Processing asent: Canny, hed said.\n","Processing asent: This woman was nothing like that kid, nothing, but telling himself so did no good.\n","Processing asent: His anger was suddenly gone, leaving him feeling sick and weak and empty.\n","Processing asent: Dont hurt me anymore, Daddy.\n","Processing asent: He got up, wiping his hand on his shirt, and walked blindly toward the Riv.\n","Processing asent: (Abra are you there)\n","Processing asent: Not so panicky now, and that was good.\n","Processing asent: (you need to have your friends mom call the police and tell them youre in danger Crows in Anniston)\n","Processing asent: Bringing the police into a business that was, at bottom, supernatural was the last thing Dan wanted, but at this moment he saw no choice.\n","Processing asent: Before she could finish, her thought was blotted out by a powerful shriek of female rage.\n","Processing asent: (YOU LITTLE BITCH)\n","Processing asent: Suddenly the hat woman was in Dans head again, this time not as part of a dream but behind his waking eyes, her image burning: a creature of terrible beauty who was now naked, her wet hair lying on her shoulders in Medusa coils.\n","Processing asent: Then her mouth yawned open and the beauty was torn away.\n","Processing asent: There was only a dark hole with one jutting, discolored tooth.\n","Processing asent: Almost a tusk.\n","Processing asent: (WHAT HAVE YOU DONE)\n","Processing asent: Dan staggered and put a hand against the Rivs lead passenger car to hold himself up.\n","Processing asent: The world inside his head was revolving.\n","Processing asent: The hat woman disappeared and suddenly a crowd of concerned faces was gathered around him.\n","Processing asent: They were asking if he was all right.\n","Processing asent: He remembered Abra trying to explain how the world had revolved on the day she had discovered Brad Trevors picture in The Anniston Shopper; how all at once Abra had been looking out of the hat womans eyes and the hat woman had been looking out of hers.\n","Processing asent: Now he understood.\n","Processing asent: It was happening again, and this time he was along for the ride.\n","Processing asent: Rose was on the ground.\n","Processing asent: He could see a broad swatch of evening sky overhead.\n","Processing asent: The people crowding around her were no doubt her tribe of child-killers.\n","Processing asent: This was what Abra was seeing.\n","Processing asent: The question was, what was Rose seeing?\n","Processing asent: Snake cycled, then came back.\n","Processing asent: It burned.\n","Processing asent: She looked at the man kneeling in front of her.\n","Processing asent: Is there anything I can do for you?\n","Processing asent: John asked.\n","Processing asent: Im a doctor.\n","Processing asent: In spite of the pain, Snake laughed.\n","Processing asent: This doctor, who belonged to the men who had just shot the Trues doctor to death, was now offering to help.\n","Processing asent: What would Hippocrates make of that one?\n","Processing asent: Put a bullet in me, assface.\n","Processing asent: Thats the only thing I can think of.\n","Processing asent: The nerdy one, the bastard whod actually pulled the trigger on Walnut, joined the one who said he was a doctor.\n","Processing asent: Youd deserve it, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Did you think I was just going to let you take my daughter?\n","Processing asent: Torture and kill her like you did that poor little boy in Iowa?\n","Processing asent: They knew about that?\n","Processing asent: How could they?\n","Processing asent: But it didnt matter now, at least not to Andi.\n","Processing asent: Your people slaughter pigs and cows and sheep.\n","Processing asent: Is what we do any different?\n","Processing asent: In my humble opinion, killing human beings is a lot different, John said.\n","Processing asent: Call me silly and sentimental.\n","Processing asent: Snakes mouth was full of blood and some lumpy shit.\n","Processing asent: Teeth, probably.\n","Processing asent: That didnt matter, either.\n","Processing asent: In the end, this might be more merciful than what Barry had gone through.\n","Processing asent: It would certainly be quicker.\n","Processing asent: But one thing needed straightening out.\n","Processing asent: Just so theyd know.\n","Processing asent: Were the human beings.\n","Processing asent: Your kind . . . just rubes.\n","Processing asent: Dave smiled, but his eyes were hard.\n","Processing asent: And yet youre the one lying on the ground with dirt in your hair and blood all down the front of your shirt.\n","Processing asent: I hope hells hot enough for you.\n","Processing asent: Snake could feel the next cycle coming on.\n","Processing asent: With luck it would be the last one, but for now she held tight to her physical form.\n","Processing asent: You dont understand how it was with me.\n","Processing asent: Before.\n","Processing asent: Or how is with us.\n","Processing asent: Were only a few, and were sick.\n","Processing asent: Weve got\n","Processing asent: I know what youve got, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Fucking measles.\n","Processing asent: I hope they rot your whole miserable Knot from the inside out.\n","Processing asent: Snake said, We didnt choose to be what we are any more than you did.\n","Processing asent: In our shoes, youd do the same.\n","Processing asent: John shook his head slowly from side to side.\n","Processing asent: Never.\n","Processing asent: Never.\n","Processing asent: Snake began to cycle out.\n","Processing asent: She managed four more words, however.\n","Processing asent: Fucking men.\n","Processing asent: A final gasp as she stared up at them from her disappearing face.\n","Processing asent: Fucking rubes.\n","Processing asent: Then she was gone.\n","Processing asent: Dan walked to John and Dave slowly and carefully, putting his hand on several of the picnic tables to keep his balance.\n","Processing asent: He had picked up Abras stuffed rabbit without even realizing it.\n","Processing asent: His head was clearing, but that was a decidedly mixed blessing.\n","Processing asent: We have to go back to Anniston, and fast.\n","Processing asent: I cant touch Billy.\n","Processing asent: I could before, but now hes gone.\n","Processing asent: Abra?\n","Processing asent: Dave asked.\n","Processing asent: What about Abra?\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt want to look at himDaves face was naked with fearbut he made himself do it.\n","Processing asent: Shes gone, too.\n","Processing asent: Sos the woman in the hat.\n","Processing asent: Theyve both dropped out of the mix.\n","Processing asent: Meaning what?\n","Processing asent: Dave grabbed Dans shirt in both hands.\n","Processing asent: Meaning what?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: This was the truth, but he was afraid.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n","Processing asent: Get with me, Daddy, Barry the Chink had said.\n","Processing asent: Lean close.\n","Processing asent: This was just after Snake had started the first of the porn DVDs.\n","Processing asent: Crow got with Barry, even held his hand while the dying man struggled through his next cycle.\n","Processing asent: And when he came back\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Listen to me.\n","Processing asent: Shes been watching, all right.\n","Processing asent: Only when that porno started up\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Explaining to someone who couldnt do the locator thing was hard, especially when the one doing the talking was mortally ill, but Crow got the gist of it.\n","Processing asent: The fucksome frolickers by the pool had shocked the girl, just as Rose had hoped they might, but they had done more than make her quit spying and pull back.\n","Processing asent: For a moment or two, Barrys sense of her location seemed to double.\n","Processing asent: She was still on the midget train with her dad, riding to the place where they were going to have their picnic, but her shock had produced a ghost image that made no sense.\n","Processing asent: In this she was in a bathroom, taking a leak.\n","Processing asent: Maybe you were seeing a memory, Crow said.\n","Processing asent: Could that be?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, Barry said.\n","Processing asent: Rubes think all kinds of crazy shit.\n","Processing asent: Most likely its nothing.\n","Processing asent: But for a minute it was like she was twins, you know?\n","Processing asent: Crow didnt, exactly, but he nodded.\n","Processing asent: Only if thats not it, she might be running some kind of game.\n","Processing asent: Gimme the map.\n","Processing asent: Jimmy Numbers had all of New Hampshire on his laptop.\n","Processing asent: Crow held it up in front of Barry.\n","Processing asent: Heres where she is, Barry said, tapping the screen.\n","Processing asent: On her way to this Cloud Glen place with her dad.\n","Processing asent: Gap, Crow said.\n","Processing asent: Cloud Gap.\n","Processing asent: Whatever the fuck.\n","Processing asent: Barry moved his finger northeast.\n","Processing asent: And this is where the ghost-blip came from.\n","Processing asent: Crow took the laptop and looked through the bead of no doubt infected sweat Barry had left on the screen.\n","Processing asent: Anniston?\n","Processing asent: Thats her hometown, Bar.\n","Processing asent: Shes probably left psychic traces of herself all over it.\n","Processing asent: Like dead skin.\n","Processing asent: Sure.\n","Processing asent: Memories.\n","Processing asent: Daydreams.\n","Processing asent: All kinds of crazy shit.\n","Processing asent: What I said.\n","Processing asent: And its gone now.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, but . . . Barry grasped Crows wrist.\n","Processing asent: If shes as strong as Rose says, its just possible that she really is gaming us.\n","Processing asent: Throwing her voice, like.\n","Processing asent: Have you ever run across a steamhead that could do that?\n","Processing asent: No, but theres a first time for everything.\n","Processing asent: Im almost positive shes with her father, but youre the one who has to decide if almost positive is good enough for\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: That was when Barry began cycling again, and all meaningful communication ceased.\n","Processing asent: Crow was left with a difficult decision.\n","Processing asent: It was his mission, and he was confident he could handle it, but it was Roses plan andmore importantRoses obsession.\n","Processing asent: If he screwed up, there would be hell to pay.\n","Processing asent: Crow glanced at his watch.\n","Processing asent: Three p.m. here in New Hampshire, one oclock in Sidewinder.\n","Processing asent: At the Bluebell Campground, lunch would just be finishing up, and Rose would be available.\n","Processing asent: That decided him.\n","Processing asent: He made the call.\n","Processing asent: He almost expected her to laugh and call him an old woman, but she didnt.\n","Processing asent: You know we cant entirely trust Barry anymore, she said, but I trust you.\n","Processing asent: Whats your gut feeling?\n","Processing asent: His gut felt nothing one way or the other; that was why he had made the call.\n","Processing asent: He told her so, and waited.\n","Processing asent: I leave it with you, she said.\n","Processing asent: Just dont screw up.\n","Processing asent: Thanks for nothing, Rosie darlin.\n","Processing asent: He thought this . . . then hoped she hadnt caught it.\n","Processing asent: He sat with the closed cell phone still in his hand, swaying from side to side with the motion of the RV, inhaling the smell of Barrys sickness, wondering how long it would be before the first spots started showing up on his own arms and legs and chest.\n","Processing asent: At last he went forward and put his hand on Jimmys shoulder.\n","Processing asent: When you get to Anniston, stop.\n","Processing asent: Because Im getting off.\n","Processing asent: Crow Daddy watched them pull away from the Gas n Go on Annistons lower Main Street, resisting an urge to send a short-range thought (all the ESP of which he was capable) to Snake before they got out of range: Come back and pick me up, this is a mistake.\n","Processing asent: Only what if it wasnt?\n","Processing asent: When they were gone, he looked briefly and longingly at the sad little line of used cars for sale at the car wash adjacent to the gas station.\n","Processing asent: No matter what transpired in Anniston, he was going to need transpo out of town.\n","Processing asent: He had more than enough cash in his wallet to buy something that would carry him to their agreed-on rendezvous point near Albany on I-87; the problem was time.\n","Processing asent: It would take at least half an hour to transact a car deal, and that might be too long.\n","Processing asent: Until he was sure this was a false alarm, he would just have to improvise and rely on his powers of persuasion.\n","Processing asent: They had never let him down yet.\n","Processing asent: Crow did take time enough to step into the Gas n Go, where he bought a Red Sox hat.\n","Processing asent: When in Bosox country, dress as the Bosox fans do.\n","Processing asent: He debated adding a pair of sunglasses and decided against them.\n","Processing asent: Thanks to TV, a fit middle-aged man in sunglasses always looked like a hit man to a certain part of the population.\n","Processing asent: The hat would have to do.\n","Processing asent: He walked up Main Street to the library where Abra and Dan had once held a council of war.\n","Processing asent: He had to go no farther than the lobby to find what he was looking for.\n","Processing asent: There, under the heading of TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TOWN, was a map of Anniston with every street and lane carefully marked.\n","Processing asent: He refreshed himself on the location of the girls street.\n","Processing asent: Great game last night, wasnt it?\n","Processing asent: a man asked.\n","Processing asent: He was carrying an armload of books.\n","Processing asent: For a moment Crow had no idea what he was talking about, then remembered his new hat.\n","Processing asent: It sure was, he agreed, still looking at the map.\n","Processing asent: He gave the Sox fan time to depart before leaving the lobby.\n","Processing asent: The hat was fine, but he had no desire to discuss baseball.\n","Processing asent: He thought it was a stupid game.\n","Processing asent: Richland Court was a short street of pleasant New England saltboxes and Cape Cods ending in a circular turnaround.\n","Processing asent: Crow had grabbed a free newspaper called The Anniston Shopper on his walk from the library and now stood at the corner, leaning against a handy oak tree and pretending to study it.\n","Processing asent: The oak shielded him from the street, and maybe that was a good thing, because there was a red truck with a guy sitting behind the wheel parked about halfway down.\n","Processing asent: The truck was an oldie, with some hand-tools and what looked like a Rototiller in the bed, so the guy could be a groundskeeperthis was the kind of street where people could afford thembut if so, why was he just sitting there?\n","Processing asent: Babysitting, maybe?\n","Processing asent: Crow was suddenly glad he had taken Barry seriously enough to jump ship.\n","Processing asent: The question was, what to do now?\n","Processing asent: He could call Rose, but their last conversation hadnt netted anything he couldnt have gotten from a Magic 8 Ball.\n","Processing asent: He was still standing half-hidden behind the fine old oak and debating his next move when the providence that favored the True Knot above rubes stepped in.\n","Processing asent: A door partway down the street opened, and two girls came out.\n","Processing asent: Crows eyes were every bit as sharp as those of his namesake bird, and he IDd them at once as two of the three girls in Billys computer pix.\n","Processing asent: The one in the brown skirt was Emma Deane.\n","Processing asent: The one in the black pants was Abra Stone.\n","Processing asent: He glanced back at the truck.\n","Processing asent: The driver, also an oldie, had been slouched behind the wheel.\n","Processing asent: Now he was sitting up.\n","Processing asent: Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n","Processing asent: On the alert.\n","Processing asent: So she had been gaming them.\n","Processing asent: Crow still didnt know for sure which of the two was the steamhead, but one thing he was sure of: the men in the Winnebago were on a wild goosechase.\n","Processing asent: Crow took out his cell but only held it in his hand for a moment, watching the girl in the black pants go down the walk to the street.\n","Processing asent: The girl in the skirt watched her for a second, then went back inside.\n","Processing asent: The girl in the pantsAbracrossed Richland Court, and as she did, the man in the truck raised his hands in a what gives gesture.\n","Processing asent: She responded with a thumbs-up: Dont worry, everythings okay.\n","Processing asent: Crow felt a surge of triumph as hot as a knock of whiskey.\n","Processing asent: Question answered.\n","Processing asent: Abra Stone was the steamhead.\n","Processing asent: No question about it.\n","Processing asent: She was being guarded, and the guard was an old geezer with a perfectly good pickup truck.\n","Processing asent: Crow felt confident it would take him and a certain young passenger as far as Albany.\n","Processing asent: He hit Snake on the speed dial, and wasnt surprised or uneasy when he got a CALL FAILED message.\n","Processing asent: Cloud Gap was a local beauty spot, and God forbid there should be any cell phone towers to clutter up the tourists snapshots.\n","Processing asent: But that was okay.\n","Processing asent: If he couldnt take care of an old man and a young girl, it was time to turn in his badge.\n","Processing asent: He considered his phone for a moment, then turned it off.\n","Processing asent: For the next twenty minutes or so, there was no one he wanted to talk to, and that included Rose.\n","Processing asent: His mission, his responsibility.\n","Processing asent: He had four loaded syringes, two in the left pocket of his light jacket, two in the right.\n","Processing asent: Putting his best Henry Rothman smile on his facethe one he wore when reserving campground space or four-walling motels for the TrueCrow stepped from behind the tree and strolled down the street.\n","Processing asent: In his left hand he still held his folded copy of The Anniston Shopper.\n","Processing asent: His right hand was in his jacket pocket, easing the plastic cap off one of the needles.\n","Processing asent: Pardon me, sir, I seem to be a little lost.\n","Processing asent: I wonder if you could give me some directions.\n","Processing asent: Billy Freeman was nervous, on edge, filled with something that was not quite foreboding . . . and still that cheerful voice and bright you-can-trust-me smile took him in.\n","Processing asent: Only for two seconds, but that was enough.\n","Processing asent: As he reached toward the open glove compartment, he felt a small sting on the side of his neck.\n","Processing asent: Bug bit me, he thought, and then slumped sideways, his eyes rolling up to the whites.\n","Processing asent: Crow opened the door and shoved the driver across the seat.\n","Processing asent: The old guys head bonked the passenger-side window.\n","Processing asent: Crow lifted limp legs over the transmission hump, batting the glove compartment closed to make a little more room, then slid behind the wheel and slammed the door.\n","Processing asent: He took a deep breath and looked around, ready for anything, but there was nothing to be ready for.\n","Processing asent: Richland Court was dozing the afternoon away, and that was lovely.\n","Processing asent: The key was in the ignition.\n","Processing asent: Crow started the engine and the radio came on in a yahoo roar of Toby Keith: God bless America and pour the beer.\n","Processing asent: As he reached to turn it off, a terrible white light momentarily washed out his vision.\n","Processing asent: Crow had very little telepathic ability, but he was firmly linked to his tribe; in a way, the members were appendages of a single organism, and one of their number had just died.\n","Processing asent: Cloud Gap hadnt been just misdirection, it had been a fucking ambush.\n","Processing asent: Before he could decide what to do next, the white light came again, and, after a pause, yet again.\n","Processing asent: All of them?\n","Processing asent: Good Christ, all three?\n","Processing asent: It wasnt possible . . . was it?\n","Processing asent: He took a deep breath, then another.\n","Processing asent: Forced himself to face the fact that yes, it could be.\n","Processing asent: And if so, he knew who was to blame.\n","Processing asent: Fucking steamhead girl.\n","Processing asent: He looked at Abras house.\n","Processing asent: All quiet there.\n","Processing asent: Thank God for small favors.\n","Processing asent: He had expected to drive the truck up the street and into her driveway, but all at once that seemed like a bad idea, at least for now.\n","Processing asent: He got out, leaned back in, and grabbed the unconscious geezer by his shirt and belt.\n","Processing asent: Crow yanked him back behind the wheel, pausing just long enough to give him a patdown.\n","Processing asent: No gun.\n","Processing asent: Too bad.\n","Processing asent: He wouldnt have minded having one, at least for awhile.\n","Processing asent: He fastened the geezers seatbelt so he couldnt tilt forward and blare the horn.\n","Processing asent: Then he walked down the street to the girls house, not hurrying.\n","Processing asent: If hed seen her face at one of the windowsor so much as a single twitch of a single curtainhe would have broken into a sprint, but nothing moved.\n","Processing asent: It was possible he could still make this work, but that consideration had been rendered strictly secondary by those terrible white flashes.\n","Processing asent: What he mostly wanted was to get his hands on the miserable bitch that had caused them so much trouble and shake her until she rattled.\n","Processing asent: Abra sleepwalked down the front hall.\n","Processing asent: The Stones had a family room in the basement, but the kitchen was their comfort place, and she headed there without thinking about it.\n","Processing asent: She stood with her hands splayed out on the table where she and her parents had eaten thousands of meals, staring at the window over the kitchen sink with wide blank eyes.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt really here at all.\n","Processing asent: She was in Cloud Gap, watching bad guys spill out of the Winnebago: the Snake and the Nut and Jimmy Numbers.\n","Processing asent: She knew their names from Barry.\n","Processing asent: But something was wrong.\n","Processing asent: One of them was missing.\n","Processing asent: (WHERES THE CROW DAN I DONT SEE THE CROW!)\n","Processing asent: No answer, because Dan and her father and Dr. John were busy.\n","Processing asent: They took the bad guys down, one after the other: the Walnut firstthat was her fathers work, and good for himthen Jimmy Numbers, then the Snake.\n","Processing asent: She felt each mortal injury as a thudding deep in her head.\n","Processing asent: Those thuds, like a heavy mallet repeatedly coming down on an oak plank, were terrible in their finality, but not entirely unpleasant.\n","Processing asent: Because\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Because they deserve it, they kill kids, and nothing else would have stopped them.\n","Processing asent: Only\n","Processing asent: (Dan wheres the Crow? WHERES THE CROW???)\n","Processing asent: Now Dan heard her.\n","Processing asent: Thank God.\n","Processing asent: She saw the Winnebago.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought the Crow was in there, and maybe he was right.\n","Processing asent: Still\n","Processing asent: She hurried back down the hall and peered out one of the windows beside the front door.\n","Processing asent: The sidewalk was deserted, but Mr. Freemans truck was parked right where it belonged.\n","Processing asent: She couldnt see his face because of the way the sun was shining on the windshield, but she could see him behind the wheel, and that meant everything was still okay.\n","Processing asent: Probably okay.\n","Processing asent: (Abra are you there)\n","Processing asent: Dan.\n","Processing asent: It was so great to hear him.\n","Processing asent: She wished he was with her, but having him inside her head was almost as good.\n","Processing asent: She took one more reassuring look at the empty sidewalk and Mr. Freemans truck, checked to make sure she had locked the door after coming in, and started back down to the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: (you need to have your friends mom call the police and tell them youre in danger Crows in Anniston)\n","Processing asent: She stopped halfway down the hall.\n","Processing asent: Her comfort-hand came up and began to rub her mouth.\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt know she had left the Deanes house.\n","Processing asent: How could he?\n","Processing asent: Hed been very busy.\n","Processing asent: Before she could finish, Rose the Hats mental voice blasted through her head, wiping away all thought.\n","Processing asent: (YOU LITTLE BITCH WHAT HAVE YOU DONE)\n","Processing asent: The familiar hallway between the front door and the kitchen began to sideslip.\n","Processing asent: The last time this revolving thing happened, shed been prepared.\n","Processing asent: This time she wasnt.\n","Processing asent: Abra tried to stop it and couldnt.\n","Processing asent: Her house was gone.\n","Processing asent: Anniston was gone.\n","Processing asent: She was lying on the ground and looking up at the sky.\n","Processing asent: Abra realized the loss of those three in Cloud Gap had literally knocked Rose off her feet, and she had a moment to be savagely glad.\n","Processing asent: She struggled for something to defend herself with.\n","Processing asent: There wasnt much time.\n","Processing asent: Roses body lay sprawled halfway between the showers and the Overlook Lodge, but her mind was in New Hampshire, swarming through the girls head.\n","Processing asent: There was no daydream horsewoman with a stallion and lance this time, oh no.\n","Processing asent: This time it was just one surprised little chickadee and old Rosie, and Rosie wanted revenge.\n","Processing asent: She would kill the girl only as a last resort, she was much too valuable for that, but Rose could give her a taste of what was coming.\n","Processing asent: A taste of what Roses friends had already suffered.\n","Processing asent: There were plenty of soft, vulnerable places in the minds of rubes, and she knew them all very w\n","Processing asent: (GET AWAY YOU BITCH LEAVE ME ALONE OR ILL FUCKING KILL YOU!)\n","Processing asent: It was like having a flash-bang go off behind her eyes.\n","Processing asent: Rose jerked and cried out.\n","Processing asent: Big Mo, who had been reaching down to touch her, recoiled in surprise.\n","Processing asent: Rose didnt notice, didnt even see her.\n","Processing asent: She kept underestimating the girls power.\n","Processing asent: She tried to keep her footing in the girls head, but the little bitch was actually pushing her out.\n","Processing asent: It was incredible and infuriating and terrifying, but it was true.\n","Processing asent: Worse, she could feel her physical hands rising toward her face.\n","Processing asent: If Mo and Short Eddie hadnt restrained her, the little girl might have made Rose claw her own eyes out.\n","Processing asent: For the time being, at least, she had to give up and leave.\n","Processing asent: But before she did, she saw something through the girls eyes that flooded her with relief.\n","Processing asent: It was Crow Daddy, and in one hand he was holding a needle.\n","Processing asent: Abra used all the psychic force she could muster, more than she had used on the day she had gone hunting for Brad Trevor, more than she had ever used in her life, and it was still barely enough.\n","Processing asent: Just when she started to think she wouldnt be able to get the hat woman out of her head, the world began to revolve again.\n","Processing asent: She was making it revolve, but it was so hardlike pushing a great stone wheel.\n","Processing asent: The sky and the faces staring down at her slid away.\n","Processing asent: There was a moment of darkness when she was\n","Processing asent: nowhere, and then her own front hall slid back into view.\n","Processing asent: But she was no longer alone.\n","Processing asent: A man was standing in the kitchen doorway.\n","Processing asent: No, not a man.\n","Processing asent: A Crow.\n","Processing asent: Hello, Abra, he said, smiling, and leaped at her.\n","Processing asent: Still mentally reeling from her encounter with Rose, Abra made no attempt to push him away with her mind.\n","Processing asent: She simply turned and ran.\n","Processing asent: In their moments of highest stress, Dan Torrance and Crow Daddy were very much alike, although neither would ever know it.\n","Processing asent: The same clarity came over Crows vision, the same sense that all of this was happening in beautiful slow motion.\n","Processing asent: He saw the pink rubber bracelet on Abras left wrist and had time to think breast cancer awareness.\n","Processing asent: He saw the girls backpack slew to the left as she whirled to her right and knew it was full of books.\n","Processing asent: He even had time to admire her hair as it flew out behind her in a bright sheaf.\n","Processing asent: He caught her at the door as she was trying to turn the thumb lock.\n","Processing asent: When he put his left arm around her throat and yanked her back, he felt her first effortsconfused, weakto push him away with her mind.\n","Processing asent: Not the whole hypo, it might kill her, she cant weigh more than a hundred and fifteen pounds max.\n","Processing asent: Crow injected her just south of the collarbone as she twisted and struggled.\n","Processing asent: He neednt have worried about losing control and shooting the whole dose into her, because her left arm came up and thumped against his right hand, knocking the hypo free.\n","Processing asent: It fell to the floor and rolled.\n","Processing asent: But providence favors True above rubes, it had always been that way and was now.\n","Processing asent: He got just enough into her.\n","Processing asent: He felt her little handhold on his mind first slip, then fall away.\n","Processing asent: Her hands did the same.\n","Processing asent: She stared at him with shocked, floating eyes.\n","Processing asent: Crow patted her shoulder.\n","Processing asent: Were going for a ride, Abra.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to meet exciting new people.\n","Processing asent: Incredibly, she managed a smile.\n","Processing asent: A rather frightening one for a girl so young that with her hair piled up under a cap, she could still have passed for a boy.\n","Processing asent: Those monsters you call your friends are all dead.\n","Processing asent: Theyyy\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: The last word was only an unwinding slur as her eyes rolled up and her knees came unhinged.\n","Processing asent: Crow was tempted to let her dropit would serve her too rightbut restrained the impulse and caught her under the arms instead.\n","Processing asent: She was valuable property, after all.\n","Processing asent: True property.\n","Processing asent: He had come in through the rear door, snapping back the next-to-useless spring lock with a single downward flick of Henry Rothmans American Express Platinum Card, but he had no intention of leaving that way.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing but a high fence at the foot of the sloping backyard, and beyond that a river.\n","Processing asent: Also, his transportation was in the other direction.\n","Processing asent: He carried Abra through the kitchen and into the empty garage.\n","Processing asent: Both parents at work, maybe . . . unless they were out at Cloud Gap, gloating over Andi, Billy, and Nut.\n","Processing asent: For now he didnt give much of a shit about that end of things; whoever had been helping the girl could wait.\n","Processing asent: Their time would come.\n","Processing asent: He slid her limp body under a table holding her fathers few tools.\n","Processing asent: Then he thumbed the button that opened the garage door and stepped out, being sure to slap on that big old Henry Rothman smile before he did.\n","Processing asent: The key to survival in the world of rubes was to look as if you belonged, as if you were always on the goodfoot, and no one was better at it than Crow.\n","Processing asent: He walked briskly down to the truck and moved the geezer again, this time to the middle of the bench seat.\n","Processing asent: As Crow turned in to the Stone driveway, Billys head lolled against his shoulder.\n","Processing asent: Gettin a little chummy there, arent you, oldtimer?\n","Processing asent: Crow asked, and laughed as he drove the red truck into the garage.\n","Processing asent: His friends were dead and this situation was horribly dangerous, but there was one big compensation: he felt totally alive and aware for the first time in a great many years, the world bursting with color and humming like a powerline.\n","Processing asent: He had her, by God.\n","Processing asent: In spite of all her weird strength and nasty tricks, he had her.\n","Processing asent: Now he would bring her to Rose.\n","Processing asent: A love offering.\n","Processing asent: Jackpot, he said, and gave the dashboard one hard, exultant hit.\n","Processing asent: He stripped off Abras backpack, left it under the worktable, and lifted her into the truck on the passenger side.\n","Processing asent: He seatbelted both of his snoozing passengers.\n","Processing asent: It had certainly occurred to him to snap the geezers neck and leave his body in the garage, but the geezer might come in handy.\n","Processing asent: If the drug didnt kill him, that was.\n","Processing asent: Crow checked for a pulse on the side of the grizzled old neck and felt it, slow but strong.\n","Processing asent: There was no question about the girl; she was leaning against the passenger window and he could see her breath fogging the glass.\n","Processing asent: Excellent.\n","Processing asent: Crow took a second to inventory his stock.\n","Processing asent: No gunthe True Knot never traveled with firearmsbut he still had two full hypos of the noddy-time night-night stuff.\n","Processing asent: He didnt know how far two would get him, but the girl was his priority.\n","Processing asent: Crow had an idea that the geezers period of usefulness might prove to be extremely limited.\n","Processing asent: Oh, well.\n","Processing asent: Rubes came and rubes went.\n","Processing asent: He took out his cell and this time it was Rose he hit on the speed dial.\n","Processing asent: She answered just as he had resigned himself to leaving a message.\n","Processing asent: Her voice was slow, her pronunciation slurry.\n","Processing asent: It was a little like talking to a drunk.\n","Processing asent: Rose?\n","Processing asent: Whats up with you?\n","Processing asent: The girl messed with me a trifle more than I expected, but Im all right.\n","Processing asent: I dont hear her anymore.\n","Processing asent: Tell me you have her.\n","Processing asent: I do, and shes having a nice nap, but shes got friends.\n","Processing asent: I dont want to meet them.\n","Processing asent: Ill head west immediately, and Ive got no time to be fucking with maps.\n","Processing asent: I need secondary roads thatll take me across Vermont and into New York.\n","Processing asent: Ill put Toady Slim on it.\n","Processing asent: You need to send someone east to meet me immediately, Rosie, and with whatever you can lay your hands on thatll keep Little Miss Nitro pacified, because I dont have much left.\n","Processing asent: Look in Nuts supplies.\n","Processing asent: He must have something\n","Processing asent: Dont tell me my business, she snapped.\n","Processing asent: Toady will coordinate everything.\n","Processing asent: You know enough to get started?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Rosie darlin, that picnic area was a trap.\n","Processing asent: The little girl fucking deked us.\n","Processing asent: What if her friends call the cops?\n","Processing asent: Im riding in an old F-150 with a couple of zombies next to me in the cab.\n","Processing asent: I might as well have KIDNAPPER tattooed on my forehead.\n","Processing asent: But he was grinning.\n","Processing asent: Damned if he wasnt grinning.\n","Processing asent: There was a pause at the other end.\n","Processing asent: Crow sat behind the wheel in the Stones garage, waiting.\n","Processing asent: At last Rose said, If you see blue lights behind you or a roadblock ahead of you, strangle the girl and suck out as much of her steam as you can while she goes.\n","Processing asent: Then surrender.\n","Processing asent: Well take care of you eventually, you know that.\n","Processing asent: It was Crows turn to pause.\n","Processing asent: At last he said, Are you sure thats the right way to go, darlin?\n","Processing asent: I am.\n","Processing asent: Her voice was stony.\n","Processing asent: Shes responsible for the deaths of Jimmy, Nut, and Snakebite.\n","Processing asent: I mourn them all, but its Andi I feel the worst about, because I Turned her myself and she only had a taste of the life.\n","Processing asent: Then theres Sarey\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: She trailed off with a sigh.\n","Processing asent: Crow said nothing.\n","Processing asent: There was really nothing to say.\n","Processing asent: Andi Steiner had been with a lot of women during her early years with the Truenot a surprise, steam always made newbies especially randybut she and Sarah Carter had been a couple for the last ten years, and devoted to each other.\n","Processing asent: In some ways, Andi had seemed more like Silent Sareys daughter than her lover.\n","Processing asent: Sareys inconsolable, Rose said, and Black-Eyed Susies not much better about Nut.\n","Processing asent: That little girl is going to answer for taking those three from us.\n","Processing asent: One way or the other, her rube life is over.\n","Processing asent: Any more questions?\n","Processing asent: Crow had none.\n","Processing asent: No one paid any particular attention to Crow Daddy and his snoozing passengers as they left Anniston on the old Granite State Highway, headed west.\n","Processing asent: With a few notable exceptions (sharp-eyed old ladies and little kids were the worst), Rube America was staggeringly unobservant even twelve years into the Dark Age of Terrorism.\n","Processing asent: If you see something, say something was a hell of a slogan, but first you had to see something.\n","Processing asent: By the time they crossed into Vermont it was growing dark, and cars passing by in the other direction saw only Crows headlights, which he purposely left on hi-beam.\n","Processing asent: Toady Slim had called three times already, feeding him route information.\n","Processing asent: Most were byroads, many unmarked.\n","Processing asent: Toady had also told Crow that Diesel Doug, Dirty Phil, and Apron Annie were on their way.\n","Processing asent: They were riding in an 06 Caprice that looked like a dog but had four hundred horses under the hood.\n","Processing asent: Speeding would not be a problem; they were also carrying Homeland Security creds that would check out all the way up the line, thanks to the late Jimmy Numbers.\n","Processing asent: The Little twins, Pea and Pod, were using the Trues sophisticated satellite communications gear to monitor police chatter in the Northeast, and so far there had been nothing about the possible kidnapping of a young girl.\n","Processing asent: This was good news, but not unexpected.\n","Processing asent: Friends smart enough to set up an ambush were probably smart enough to know what could happen to their chickadee if they went public.\n","Processing asent: Another phone rang, this one muffled.\n","Processing asent: Without taking his eyes off the road, Crow leaned across his sleeping passengers, reached into the glove compartment, and found a cell.\n","Processing asent: The geezers, no doubt.\n","Processing asent: He held it up to his eyes.\n","Processing asent: There was no name, so the caller wasnt in the phones memory, but the number had a New Hampshire area code.\n","Processing asent: One of the ambushers, wanting to know if Billy and the girl were all right?\n","Processing asent: Very likely.\n","Processing asent: Crow considered answering it and decided not to.\n","Processing asent: He would check later to see if the caller had left a message, though.\n","Processing asent: Information was power.\n","Processing asent: When he leaned over again to return the cell to the glove compartment, his fingers touched metal.\n","Processing asent: He stowed the phone and brought out an automatic pistol.\n","Processing asent: A nice bonus, and a lucky find.\n","Processing asent: If the geezer had awakened a little sooner than expected, he might have gotten to it before Crow could read his intentions.\n","Processing asent: Crow slid the Glock under his seat, then flipped the glove compartment closed.\n","Processing asent: Guns were also power.\n","Processing asent: It was full dark and they were deep into the Green Mountains on Highway 108 when Abra began to stir.\n","Processing asent: Crow, still feeling brilliantly alive and aware, wasnt sorry.\n","Processing asent: For one thing, he was curious about her.\n","Processing asent: For another, the old trucks gas gauge was touching empty, and someone was going to have to fill the tank.\n","Processing asent: But it wouldnt do to take chances.\n","Processing asent: With his right hand he removed one of the two remaining hypos from his pocket and held it on his thigh.\n","Processing asent: He waited until the girls eyesstill soft and muzzyopened.\n","Processing asent: Then he said, Good evening, little lady.\n","Processing asent: Im Henry Rothman.\n","Processing asent: Do you understand me?\n","Processing asent: Youre . . . Abra cleared her throat, wet her lips, tried again.\n","Processing asent: Youre not Henry anything.\n","Processing asent: Youre the Crow.\n","Processing asent: So you do understand.\n","Processing asent: Thats good.\n","Processing asent: You feel woolly-headed just now, I imagine, and youre going to stay that way, because thats just how I like you.\n","Processing asent: But there will be no need to knock you all the way out again as long as you mind your Ps and Qs.\n","Processing asent: Have you got that?\n","Processing asent: Where are we going?\n","Processing asent: Hogwarts, to watch the International Quidditch Tourney.\n","Processing asent: Ill buy you a magic hotdog and a cone of magic cotton candy.\n","Processing asent: Answer my question.\n","Processing asent: Are you going to mind your Ps and Qs?\n","Processing asent: Such instant agreement is pleasing to the ear, but youll have to pardon me if I dont completely trust it.\n","Processing asent: I need to give you some vital information before you try something foolish that you might regret.\n","Processing asent: Do you see the needle I have?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Abras head was still resting against the window, but she looked down at the hypo.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes drifted shut then opened again, very slowly.\n","Processing asent: Im thirsty.\n","Processing asent: From the drug, no doubt.\n","Processing asent: I dont have anything to drink with me, we left in a bit of a hurry\n","Processing asent: I think theres a juice box in my pack.\n","Processing asent: Husky.\n","Processing asent: Low and slow.\n","Processing asent: The eyes still opening with great effort after every blink.\n","Processing asent: Afraid thats back in your garage.\n","Processing asent: You may get something to drink in the next town we come toif youre a good little Goldilocks.\n","Processing asent: If youre a bad little Goldilocks, you can spend the night swallowing your own spit.\n","Processing asent: Clear?\n","Processing asent: If I feel you fiddling around inside my headyes, I know you can do itor if you try attracting attention when we stop, Ill inject this old gentleman.\n","Processing asent: On top of what I already gave him, it will kill him as dead as Amy Winehouse.\n","Processing asent: Are we clear on that, as well?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: She licked her lips again, then rubbed them with her hand.\n","Processing asent: Dont hurt him.\n","Processing asent: Thats up to you.\n","Processing asent: Where are you taking me?\n","Processing asent: Goldilocks?\n","Processing asent: Dear?\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: She blinked at him dazedly.\n","Processing asent: Just shut up and enjoy the ride.\n","Processing asent: Hogwarts, she said.\n","Processing asent: Cotton . . . candy.\n","Processing asent: This time when her eyes closed, the lids stayed down.\n","Processing asent: She began to snore lightly.\n","Processing asent: It was a breezy sound, sort of pleasant.\n","Processing asent: Crow didnt think she was shamming, but he continued to hold the hypo next to the geezers leg just to be sure.\n","Processing asent: As Gollum had once said about Frodo Baggins, it was tricksy, precious.\n","Processing asent: It was very tricksy.\n","Processing asent: Abra didnt go under completely; she still heard the trucks motor, but it was far away.\n","Processing asent: It seemed to be above her.\n","Processing asent: It made her remember when she and her parents went to Lake Winnipesaukee on hot summer afternoons, and how you could hear the distant drone of the motorboats if you ducked your head underwater.\n","Processing asent: She knew she was being kidnapped, and she knew this should concern her, but she felt serene, content to float between sleep and waking.\n","Processing asent: The dryness in her mouth and throat was horrible, though.\n","Processing asent: Her tongue felt like a strip of dusty carpet.\n","Processing asent: I have to do something.\n","Processing asent: Hes taking me to the hat woman and I have to do something.\n","Processing asent: If I dont, theyll kill me like they killed the baseball boy.\n","Processing asent: Or something even worse.\n","Processing asent: She would do something.\n","Processing asent: After she got something to drink.\n","Processing asent: And after she slept a little more\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: The engine sound had faded from a drone to a distant hum when light penetrated her closed eyelids.\n","Processing asent: Then the sound stopped completely and the Crow was poking her in the leg.\n","Processing asent: Easy at first, then harder.\n","Processing asent: Hard enough to hurt.\n","Processing asent: Wake up, Goldilocks.\n","Processing asent: You can go back to sleep later.\n","Processing asent: She struggled her eyes open, wincing at the brightness.\n","Processing asent: They were parked beside some gas pumps.\n","Processing asent: There were fluorescents over them.\n","Processing asent: She shielded her eyes from the glare.\n","Processing asent: Now she had a headache to go with her thirst.\n","Processing asent: It was like\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Whats funny, Goldilocks?\n","Processing asent: Youre smiling.\n","Processing asent: I just figured out whats wrong with me.\n","Processing asent: Im hungover.\n","Processing asent: Crow considered this, and grinned.\n","Processing asent: I suppose you are at that, and you didnt even get to prance around with a lampshade on your head.\n","Processing asent: Are you awake enough to understand me?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: At least she thought she was.\n","Processing asent: Oh, but the thudding in her head.\n","Processing asent: Awful.\n","Processing asent: Take this.\n","Processing asent: He was holding something in front of her face, reaching across his body with his left hand to do it.\n","Processing asent: His right one still held the hypodermic, the needle resting next to Mr. Freemans leg.\n","Processing asent: She squinted.\n","Processing asent: It was a credit card.\n","Processing asent: She reached up with a hand that felt too heavy and took it.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes started to close and he slapped her face.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes flew open, wide and shocked.\n","Processing asent: She had never been hit in her life, not by an adult, anyway.\n","Processing asent: Of course she had never been kidnapped, either.\n","Processing asent: Get out of the truck.\n","Processing asent: Follow the instructions on the pumpyoure a bright kid, Im sure you can do thatand fill the tank.\n","Processing asent: Then replace the nozzle and get back in.\n","Processing asent: If you do all that like a good little Goldilocks, well drive over to yonder Coke machine.\n","Processing asent: He pointed to the far corner of the store.\n","Processing asent: You can get a nice big twenty-ounce soda.\n","Processing asent: Or a water, if thats what you want; I spy with my little eye that they have Dasani.\n","Processing asent: If youre a bad little Goldilocks, Ill kill the old man, then go into the store and kill the kid at the register.\n","Processing asent: No problem there.\n","Processing asent: Your friend had a gun, which is now in my possession.\n","Processing asent: Ill take you with me and you can watch the kids head go splat.\n","Processing asent: Its up to you, okay?\n","Processing asent: You get it?\n","Processing asent: Yes, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: A little more awake now.\n","Processing asent: Can I have a Coke and a water?\n","Processing asent: His grin this time was high, wide, and handsome.\n","Processing asent: In spite of her situation, in spite of the headache, even in spite of the slap hed administered, Abra found it charming.\n","Processing asent: She guessed lots of people found it charming, especially women.\n","Processing asent: A little greedy, but thats not always a bad thing.\n","Processing asent: Lets see how you mind those Ps and Qs.\n","Processing asent: She unbuckled her beltit took three tries, but she finally managedand grabbed the doorhandle.\n","Processing asent: Before she got out, she said: Stop calling me Goldilocks.\n","Processing asent: You know my name, and I know yours.\n","Processing asent: She slammed the door and headed for the gas island (weaving a little) before he could reply.\n","Processing asent: She had spunk as well as steam.\n","Processing asent: He could almost admire her.\n","Processing asent: But, given what had happened to Snake, Nut, and Jimmy, almost was as far as it went.\n","Processing asent: At first Abra couldnt read the instructions because the words kept doubling and sliding around.\n","Processing asent: She squinted and they came into focus.\n","Processing asent: The Crow was watching her.\n","Processing asent: She could feel his eyes like tiny warm weights on the back of her neck.\n","Processing asent: Nothing, and she wasnt surprised.\n","Processing asent: How could she hope to reach Dan when she could barely figure out how to run this stupid pump?\n","Processing asent: She had never felt less shiny in her life.\n","Processing asent: Eventually she managed to start the gas, although the first time she tried his credit card, she put it in upside-down and had to begin all over again.\n","Processing asent: The pumping seemed to go on forever, but there was a rubber sleeve over the nozzle to keep the stench of the fumes down, and the night air was clearing her head a little.\n","Processing asent: There were billions of stars.\n","Processing asent: Usually they awed her with their beauty and profusion, but tonight looking at them only made her feel scared.\n","Processing asent: They were far away.\n","Processing asent: They didnt see Abra Stone.\n","Processing asent: When the tank was full, she squinted at the new message in the pumps window and turned to Crow.\n","Processing asent: Do you want a receipt?\n","Processing asent: I think we can crutch along without that, dont you?\n","Processing asent: Again came his dazzling grin, the kind that made you happy if you were the one who caused it to break out.\n","Processing asent: Abra bet he had lots of girlfriends.\n","Processing asent: He just has one.\n","Processing asent: The hat woman is his girlfriend.\n","Processing asent: Rose.\n","Processing asent: If he had another one, Rose would kill her.\n","Processing asent: Probably with her teeth and fingernails.\n","Processing asent: She trudged back to the truck and got in.\n","Processing asent: That was very good, Crow said.\n","Processing asent: You win the grand prizea Coke and a water.\n","Processing asent: So . . . what do you say to your Daddy?\n","Processing asent: Thank you, Abra said listlessly.\n","Processing asent: But youre not my daddy.\n","Processing asent: I could be, though.\n","Processing asent: I can be a very good daddy to little girls who are good to me.\n","Processing asent: The ones who mind their Ps and Qs.\n","Processing asent: He drove to the machine and gave her a five-dollar bill.\n","Processing asent: Get me a Fanta if they have it.\n","Processing asent: A Coke if they dont.\n","Processing asent: You drink sodas, like anyone else?\n","Processing asent: He made a comical wounded face.\n","Processing asent: If you prick us, do we not bleed?\n","Processing asent: If you tickle us, do we not laugh?\n","Processing asent: Shakespeare, right?\n","Processing asent: She wiped her mouth again.\n","Processing asent: Romeo and Juliet.\n","Processing asent: Merchant of Venice, dummocks, Crow said . . . but with a smile.\n","Processing asent: Dont know the rest of it, I bet.\n","Processing asent: She shook her head.\n","Processing asent: A mistake.\n","Processing asent: It refreshed the throbbing, which had begun to diminish.\n","Processing asent: If you poison us, do we not die?\n","Processing asent: He tapped the needle against Mr. Freemans leg.\n","Processing asent: Meditate on that while you get our drinks.\n","Processing asent: He watched closely as she operated the machine.\n","Processing asent: This gas stop was on the wooded outskirts of some little town, and there was always a chance she might decide to hell with the geezer and run for the trees.\n","Processing asent: He thought of the gun, but left it where it was.\n","Processing asent: Chasing her down would be no great task, given her current soupy condition.\n","Processing asent: But she didnt even look in that direction.\n","Processing asent: She slid the five-spot into the machine and got the drinks, one after the other, pausing only to drink deeply from the water.\n","Processing asent: She came back and gave him his Fanta, but didnt get in.\n","Processing asent: Instead she pointed farther down the side of the building.\n","Processing asent: I need to pee.\n","Processing asent: Crow was flummoxed.\n","Processing asent: This was something he hadnt foreseen, although he should have.\n","Processing asent: She had been drugged, and her body needed to purge itself of toxins.\n","Processing asent: Cant you hold it awhile?\n","Processing asent: He was thinking that a few more miles down the road, he could find a turnout and pull in.\n","Processing asent: Let her go behind a bush.\n","Processing asent: As long as he could see the top of her head, theyd be fine.\n","Processing asent: But she shook her head.\n","Processing asent: Of course she did.\n","Processing asent: He thought it over.\n","Processing asent: Okay, listen up.\n","Processing asent: You can use the ladies toilet if the doors unlocked.\n","Processing asent: If its not, youll have to take your leak around back.\n","Processing asent: Theres no way Im letting you go inside and ask the counterboy for the key.\n","Processing asent: And if I have to go in back, youll watch me, I suppose.\n","Processing asent: Pervo.\n","Processing asent: Therell be a Dumpster or something you can squat behind.\n","Processing asent: It would break my heart not to get a look at your precious little buns, but Id try to survive.\n","Processing asent: Now get in the truck.\n","Processing asent: But you said\n","Processing asent: Get in, or Ill start calling you Goldilocks again.\n","Processing asent: She got in, and he pulled the truck up next to the bathroom doors, not quite blocking them.\n","Processing asent: Now hold out your hand.\n","Processing asent: Just do it.\n","Processing asent: Very reluctantly, she held out her hand.\n","Processing asent: He took it.\n","Processing asent: When she saw the needle, she tried to pull back.\n","Processing asent: Dont worry, just a drop.\n","Processing asent: We cant have you thinking bad thoughts, now can we?\n","Processing asent: Or broadcasting them.\n","Processing asent: This is going to happen one way or the other, so why make a production of it?\n","Processing asent: She stopped trying to pull away.\n","Processing asent: It was easier just to let it happen.\n","Processing asent: There was a brief sting on the back of her hand, then he released her.\n","Processing asent: Go on, now.\n","Processing asent: Make wee-wee and make it quick.\n","Processing asent: As the old song says, sand is a-runnin through the hourglass back home.\n","Processing asent: I dont know any song like that.\n","Processing asent: Not surprised.\n","Processing asent: You dont even know The Merchant of Venice from Romeo and Juliet.\n","Processing asent: Youre mean.\n","Processing asent: I dont have to be, he said.\n","Processing asent: She got out and just stood beside the truck for a moment, taking deep breaths.\n","Processing asent: She looked at him.\n","Processing asent: Dont try locking yourself in.\n","Processing asent: You know whod pay for that, dont you?\n","Processing asent: He patted Billy Freemans leg.\n","Processing asent: Her head, which had begun to clear, was fogging in again.\n","Processing asent: Horrible manhorrible thingbehind that charming grin.\n","Processing asent: And smart.\n","Processing asent: He thought of everything.\n","Processing asent: She tried the bathroom door and it opened.\n","Processing asent: At least she wouldnt have to whizz out back in the weeds, and that was something.\n","Processing asent: She went inside, shut the door, and took care of her business.\n","Processing asent: Then she simply sat there on the toilet with her swimming head hung down.\n","Processing asent: She thought of being in the bathroom at Emmas house, when she had foolishly believed everything was going to turn out all right.\n","Processing asent: How long ago that seemed.\n","Processing asent: I have to do something.\n","Processing asent: But she was doped up, woozy.\n","Processing asent: She sent this with all the force she could muster . . . which wasnt much.\n","Processing asent: And how much time would the Crow give her?\n","Processing asent: She felt despair wash over her, undermining what little will to resist was left.\n","Processing asent: All she wanted to do was button her pants, get into the truck again, and go back to sleep.\n","Processing asent: Yet she tried one more time.\n","Processing asent: (Dan! Dan, please!)\n","Processing asent: And waited for a miracle.\n","Processing asent: What she got instead was a single brief tap of the pickup trucks horn.\n","Processing asent: The message was clear: times up.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n","Processing asent: You will remember what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: In the aftermath of the Pyrrhic victory at Cloud Gap, the phrase haunted Dan, like a snatch of irritating and nonsensical music that gets in your head and wont let go, the kind you find yourself humming even as you stumble to the bathroom in the middle of the night.\n","Processing asent: This one was plenty irritating, but not quite nonsensical.\n","Processing asent: For some reason he associated it with Tony.\n","Processing asent: You will remember what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: There was no question of taking the True Knots Winnebago back to their cars, which were parked at Teenytown Station on the Frazier town common.\n","Processing asent: Even if they hadnt been afraid of being observed getting out of it or leaving forensic evidence inside it, they would have refused without needing to take a vote on the matter.\n","Processing asent: It smelled of more than sickness and death; it smelled of evil.\n","Processing asent: Dan had another reason.\n","Processing asent: He didnt know if members of the True Knot came back as ghostie people or not, but he didnt want to find out.\n","Processing asent: So they threw the abandoned clothes and the drug paraphernalia into the Saco, where the stuff that didnt sink would float downstream to Maine, and went back as they had come, in The Helen Rivington.\n","Processing asent: David Stone dropped into the conductors seat, saw that Dan was still holding Abras stuffed rabbit, and held out his hand for it.\n","Processing asent: Dan passed it over willingly enough, taking note of what Abras father held in his other hand: his BlackBerry.\n","Processing asent: What are you going to do with that?\n","Processing asent: Dave looked at the woods flowing by on both sides of the narrow-gauge tracks, then back at Dan.\n","Processing asent: As soon as we get to where theres cell coverage, Im going to call the Deanes house.\n","Processing asent: If theres no answer, Im going to call the police.\n","Processing asent: If there is an answer, and either Emma or her mother tells me that Abras gone, Im going to call the police.\n","Processing asent: Assuming they havent already.\n","Processing asent: His gaze was cool and measuring and far from friendly, but at least he was keeping his fear for his daughterhis terror, more likelyat bay, and Dan respected him for that.\n","Processing asent: Also, it would make him easier to reason with.\n","Processing asent: I hold you responsible for this, Mr. Torrance.\n","Processing asent: It was your plan.\n","Processing asent: Your crazy plan.\n","Processing asent: No use pointing out that they had all signed on to the crazy plan.\n","Processing asent: Or that he and John were almost as sick about Abras continued silence as her father.\n","Processing asent: Basically, the man was right.\n","Processing asent: You will remember what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: Was that another Overlook memory?\n","Processing asent: Dan thought it was.\n","Processing asent: But why now?\n","Processing asent: Why here?\n","Processing asent: Dave, shes almost certainly been taken.\n","Processing asent: That was John Dalton.\n","Processing asent: He had moved up to the car just behind them.\n","Processing asent: The last of the lowering sun came through the trees and flickered on his face.\n","Processing asent: If thats the case and you tell the police, what do you think will happen to Abra?\n","Processing asent: God bless you, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: If Id been the one to say it, I doubt if he would have listened.\n","Processing asent: Because, at bottom, Im the stranger who was conspiring with his daughter.\n","Processing asent: Hell never be completely convinced that Im not the one who got her into this mess.\n","Processing asent: What else can we do?\n","Processing asent: Dave asked, and then his fragile calm broke.\n","Processing asent: He began to weep, and held Abras stuffed rabbit to his face.\n","Processing asent: What am I going to tell my wife?\n","Processing asent: That I was shooting people in Cloud Gap while some bogeyman was stealing our daughter?\n","Processing asent: First things first, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: He didnt think AA slogans like Let go and let God or Take it easy would fly with Abras dad right now.\n","Processing asent: You should call the Deanes when you get cell coverage.\n","Processing asent: I think youll reach them, and theyll be fine.\n","Processing asent: You think this why?\n","Processing asent: In my last communication with Abra, I told her to have her friends mom call the police.\n","Processing asent: Dave blinked.\n","Processing asent: You really did?\n","Processing asent: Or are you just saying that now to cover your ass?\n","Processing asent: I really did.\n","Processing asent: Abra started to answer.\n","Processing asent: She said Im not, and then I lost her.\n","Processing asent: I think she was going to tell me she wasnt at the Deanes anymore.\n","Processing asent: Is she alive?\n","Processing asent: Dave grasped Dans elbow with a hand that was dead cold.\n","Processing asent: Is my daughter still alive?\n","Processing asent: I havent heard from her, but Im sure she is.\n","Processing asent: Of course youd say that, Dave whispered.\n","Processing asent: CYA, right?\n","Processing asent: Dan bit back a retort.\n","Processing asent: If they started squabbling, any thin chance of getting Abra back would become no chance.\n","Processing asent: It makes sense, John said.\n","Processing asent: Although he was still pale and his hands werent quite steady, he was using his calm bedside manner voice.\n","Processing asent: Dead, shes no good to the one whos left.\n","Processing asent: The one who grabbed her.\n","Processing asent: Alive, shes a hostage.\n","Processing asent: Also, they want her for . . . well\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: They want her for her essence, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: The steam.\n","Processing asent: Another thing, John said.\n","Processing asent: What are you going to tell the cops about the men we killed?\n","Processing asent: That they started cycling in and out of invisibility until they disappeared completely?\n","Processing asent: And then we got rid of their . . . their leavings?\n","Processing asent: I cant believe I let you get me into this.\n","Processing asent: Dave was twisting the rabbit from side to side.\n","Processing asent: Soon the old toy would split open and spill its stuffing.\n","Processing asent: Dan wasnt sure he could bear to see that.\n","Processing asent: John said, Listen, Dave.\n","Processing asent: For your daughters sake, you have to clear your mind.\n","Processing asent: Shes been in this ever since she saw that boys picture in the Shopper and tried to find out about him.\n","Processing asent: As soon as the one Abra calls the hat woman was aware of her, she almost had to come after her.\n","Processing asent: I dont know about steam, and I know very little about what Dan calls the shining, but I know people like the ones were dealing with dont leave witnesses.\n","Processing asent: And when it comes to the Iowa boy, thats what your daughter was.\n","Processing asent: Call the Deanes but keep it light, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Light?\n","Processing asent: Light?\n","Processing asent: He looked like a man trying out a word in Swedish.\n","Processing asent: Say you want to ask Abra if theres anything you should pick up at the storebread or milk or something like that.\n","Processing asent: If they say she went home, just say fine, youll reach her there.\n","Processing asent: Then what?\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt know.\n","Processing asent: All he knew was that he needed to think.\n","Processing asent: He needed to think about what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: John did know.\n","Processing asent: Then you try to reach Billy Freeman.\n","Processing asent: It was dusk, with the Rivs headlight cutting a visible cone up the aisle of the tracks, before Dave got bars on his phone.\n","Processing asent: He called the Deanes, and although he was clutching the now-deformed Hoppy in a mighty grip and large beads of sweat were trickling down his face, Dan thought he did a pretty good job.\n","Processing asent: Could Abby come to the phone for a minute and tell him if they needed anything at the Stop & Shop?\n","Processing asent: She did?\n","Processing asent: Then hed try her at home.\n","Processing asent: He listened a moment longer, said hed be sure to do that, and ended the call.\n","Processing asent: He looked at Dan, his eyes white-rimmed holes in his face.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Deane wanted me to find out how Abras feeling.\n","Processing asent: Apparently she went home complaining of menstrual cramps.\n","Processing asent: He hung his head.\n","Processing asent: I didnt even know shed started having periods.\n","Processing asent: Lucy never said.\n","Processing asent: There are things dads dont need to know, John said.\n","Processing asent: Now try Billy.\n","Processing asent: I dont have his number.\n","Processing asent: He gave a single chop of a laughHA!\n","Processing asent: Were one fucked-up posse.\n","Processing asent: Dan recited it from memory.\n","Processing asent: Up ahead the trees were thinning, and he could see the glow of the streetlights along Fraziers main drag.\n","Processing asent: Dave punched in the number and listened.\n","Processing asent: Listened some more, then killed the call.\n","Processing asent: Voice mail.\n","Processing asent: The three men were silent as the Riv broke out of the trees and rolled the last two miles toward Teenytown.\n","Processing asent: Dan tried again to reach Abra, throwing his mental voice with all the energy he could muster, and got nothing back.\n","Processing asent: The one she called the Crow had probably knocked her out somehow.\n","Processing asent: The tattoo woman had been carrying a needle.\n","Processing asent: Probably the Crow had another one.\n","Processing asent: You will remember what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: The origin of that thought arose from the very back of his mind, where he kept the lockboxes containing all the terrible memories of the Overlook Hotel and the ghosts who had infested it.\n","Processing asent: It was the boiler.\n","Processing asent: In the conductors seat, Dave glanced at him.\n","Processing asent: Huh?\n","Processing asent: The Overlooks heating system had been ancient.\n","Processing asent: The steam pressure had to be dumped at regular intervals or it crept up and up to the point where the boiler could explode and send the whole hotel sky-high.\n","Processing asent: In his steepening descent into dementia, Jack Torrance had forgotten this, but his young son had been warned.\n","Processing asent: By Tony.\n","Processing asent: Was this another warning, or just a maddening mnemonic brought on by stress and guilt?\n","Processing asent: Because he did feel guilty.\n","Processing asent: John was right, Abra was going to be a True target no matter what, but feelings were invulnerable to rational thought.\n","Processing asent: It had been his plan, the plan had gone wrong, and he was on the hook.\n","Processing asent: You will remember what was forgotten.\n","Processing asent: Was it the voice of his old friend, trying to tell him something about their current situation, or just the gramophone?\n","Processing asent: Dave and John went back to the Stone house together.\n","Processing asent: Dan followed in his own car, delighted to be alone with his thoughts.\n","Processing asent: Not that it seemed to help.\n","Processing asent: He was almost positive there was something there, something real, but it wouldnt come.\n","Processing asent: He even tried to summon Tony, a thing he hadnt attempted since his teenage years, and had no luck.\n","Processing asent: Billys truck was no longer parked on Richland Court.\n","Processing asent: To Dan, that made sense.\n","Processing asent: The True Knot raiding party had come in the Winnebago.\n","Processing asent: If they dropped the Crow off in Anniston, he would have been on foot and in need of a vehicle.\n","Processing asent: The garage was open.\n","Processing asent: Dave got out of Johns car before it pulled completely to a stop and ran inside, calling Abras name.\n","Processing asent: Then, spotlighted in the headlights of Johns Suburban like an actor on a stage, he lifted something up and uttered a sound somewhere between a groan and a scream.\n","Processing asent: As Dan pulled up next to the Suburban, he saw what it was: Abras backpack.\n","Processing asent: The urge to drink came on Dan then, even stronger than the night hed called John from the parking lot of the cowboy-boogie bar, stronger than in all the years since hed picked up a white chip at his first meeting.\n","Processing asent: The urge to simply reverse down the driveway, ignoring their shouts, and drive back to Frazier.\n","Processing asent: There was a bar there called the Bull Moose.\n","Processing asent: Hed been past it many times, always with the recovered drunks reflexive speculationswhat was it like inside?\n","Processing asent: What was on draft?\n","Processing asent: What kind of music was on the juke?\n","Processing asent: What whiskey was on the shelf and what kind in the well?\n","Processing asent: Were there any good-looking ladies?\n","Processing asent: And what would that first drink taste like?\n","Processing asent: Would it taste like home?\n","Processing asent: Like finally coming home?\n","Processing asent: He could answer at least some of those questions before Dave Stone called the cops and the cops took him in for questioning in the matter of a certain little girls disappearance.\n","Processing asent: A time will come, Casey had told him in those early white-knuckle days, when your mental defenses will fail and the only thing left standing between you and a drink will be your Higher Power.\n","Processing asent: Dan had no problem with the Higher Power thing, because he had a bit of inside information.\n","Processing asent: God remained an unproven hypothesis, but he knew there really was another plane of existence.\n","Processing asent: Like Abra, Dan had seen the ghostie people.\n","Processing asent: So sure, God was possible.\n","Processing asent: Given his glimpses of the world beyond the world, Dan thought it even likely . . . although what kind of God only sat by while shit like this played out?\n","Processing asent: As if youre the first one to ask that question, he thought.\n","Processing asent: Casey Kingsley had told him to get down on his knees twice a day, asking for help in the morning and saying thanks at night.\n","Processing asent: Its the first three steps: I cant, God can, I think Ill let Him.\n","Processing asent: Dont think too much about it.\n","Processing asent: To newcomers reluctant to take this advice, Casey was wont to offer a story about the film director John Waters.\n","Processing asent: In one of his early movies, Pink Flamingos, Waterss drag-queen star, Divine, had eaten a bit of dog excrement off a suburban lawn.\n","Processing asent: Years later, Waters was still being asked about that glorious moment of cinematic history.\n","Processing asent: Finally he snapped.\n","Processing asent: It was just a little piece of dogshit, he told a reporter, and it made her a star.\n","Processing asent: So get down on your knees and ask for help even if you dont like it, Casey always finished.\n","Processing asent: After all, its just a little piece of dogshit.\n","Processing asent: Dan couldnt very well get on his knees behind the steering wheel of his car, but he assumed the automatic default position of his morning and nightly prayerseyes closed and one palm pressed against his lips, as if to keep out even a trickle of the seductive poison that had scarred twenty years of his life.\n","Processing asent: God, help me not to dri\n","Processing asent: He got that far and the light broke.\n","Processing asent: It was what Dave had said on their way to Cloud Gap.\n","Processing asent: It was Abras angry smile (Dan wondered if the Crow had seen that smile yet, and what he made of it, if so).\n","Processing asent: Most of all, it was the feel of his own skin, pressing his lips back against his teeth.\n","Processing asent: Oh my God, he whispered.\n","Processing asent: He got out of the car and his legs gave way.\n","Processing asent: He fell on his knees after all, but got up and ran into the garage, where the two men were standing and looking at Abras abandoned pack.\n","Processing asent: He grabbed Dave Stones shoulder.\n","Processing asent: Call your wife.\n","Processing asent: Tell her youre coming to see her.\n","Processing asent: Shell want to know what its about, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: It was clear from his quivering mouth and downcast eyes how little he wanted to have that conversation.\n","Processing asent: Shes staying at Chettas apartment.\n","Processing asent: Ill tell her . . . Christ, I dont know what Ill tell her.\n","Processing asent: Dan gripped tighter, increasing the pressure until the lowered eyes came up and met his.\n","Processing asent: Were all going to Boston, but John and I have other business to take care of there.\n","Processing asent: What other business?\n","Processing asent: I dont understand.\n","Processing asent: Dan did.\n","Processing asent: Not everything, but a lot.\n","Processing asent: They took Johns Suburban.\n","Processing asent: Dave rode shotgun.\n","Processing asent: Dan lay in the back with his head on an armrest and his feet on the floor.\n","Processing asent: Lucy kept trying to get me to tell her what it was about, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: She told me I was scaring her.\n","Processing asent: And of course she thought it was Abra, because shes got a little of what Abras got.\n","Processing asent: Ive always known it.\n","Processing asent: I told her Abby was staying the night at Emmas house.\n","Processing asent: Do you know how many times Ive lied to my wife in the years weve been married?\n","Processing asent: I could count them on one hand, and three of them would be about how much I lost in the Thursday night poker games the head of my department runs.\n","Processing asent: Nothing like this.\n","Processing asent: And in just three hours, Im going to have to eat it.\n","Processing asent: Of course Dan and John knew what hed said about Abra, and how upset Lucy had been at her husbands continued insistence that the matter was too important and complex to go into on the telephone.\n","Processing asent: They had both been in the kitchen when he made the call.\n","Processing asent: But he needed to talk.\n","Processing asent: To share, in AA-speak.\n","Processing asent: John took care of any responses that needed to be made, saying uh-huh and I know and I understand.\n","Processing asent: At some point, Dave broke off and looked into the backseat.\n","Processing asent: Jesus God, are you sleeping?\n","Processing asent: No, Dan said without opening his eyes.\n","Processing asent: Im trying to get in touch with your daughter.\n","Processing asent: That ended Daves monologue.\n","Processing asent: Now there was only the hum of the tires as the Suburban ran south on Route 16 through a dozen little towns.\n","Processing asent: Traffic was light and John kept the speedometer pegged at a steady sixty miles an hour once the two lanes broadened to four.\n","Processing asent: Dan made no effort to call Abra; he wasnt sure that would work.\n","Processing asent: Instead he tried to open his mind completely.\n","Processing asent: To turn himself into a listening post.\n","Processing asent: He had never attempted anything like this before, and the result was eerie.\n","Processing asent: It was like wearing the worlds most powerful set of headphones.\n","Processing asent: He seemed to hear a steady low rushing sound, and believed it was the hum of human thoughts.\n","Processing asent: He held himself ready to hear her voice somewhere in that steady surf, not really expecting it, but what else could he do?\n","Processing asent: It was shortly after they went through the first tolls on the Spaulding Turnpike, now only sixty miles from Boston, that he finally picked her up.\n","Processing asent: Low.\n","Processing asent: Barely there.\n","Processing asent: At first he thought it was just imaginationwish fulfillmentbut he turned in that direction anyway, trying to narrow his concentration down to a single searchlight beam.\n","Processing asent: And it came again, a bit louder this time.\n","Processing asent: It was real.\n","Processing asent: It was her.\n","Processing asent: (Dan, please!)\n","Processing asent: She was drugged, all right, and hed never tried anything remotely like what had to be done next . . . but Abra had.\n","Processing asent: She would have to show him the way, doped up or not.\n","Processing asent: (Abra push you have to help me)\n","Processing asent: (help what help how)\n","Processing asent: (swapsies)\n","Processing asent: (help me turn the world)\n","Processing asent: Dave was in the passenger seat, going through the change in the cup holder for the next toll, when Dan spoke from behind him.\n","Processing asent: Only it most certainly wasnt Dan.\n","Processing asent: Just give me another minute, I have to change my tampon!\n","Processing asent: The Suburban swerved as John sat up straight and jerked the wheel.\n","Processing asent: What the hell?\n","Processing asent: Dave unsnapped his seatbelt and got on his knees, twisting around to peer at the man lying on the backseat.\n","Processing asent: Dans eyes were half-lidded, but when Dave spoke Abras name, they opened.\n","Processing asent: No, Daddy, not now, I have to help . . . I have to try . . . Dans body twisted.\n","Processing asent: One hand came up, wiped his mouth in a gesture Dave had seen a thousand times, then fell away.\n","Processing asent: Tell him I said not to call me that.\n","Processing asent: Tell him\n","Processing asent: Dans head cocked sideways until it was lying on his shoulder.\n","Processing asent: He groaned.\n","Processing asent: His hands twitched aimlessly.\n","Processing asent: Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: John shouted.\n","Processing asent: What do I do?\n","Processing asent: I dont know, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: He reached between the seats, took one of the twitching hands, and held it tight.\n","Processing asent: Drive, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Just drive.\n","Processing asent: Then the body on the backseat began to buck and twist.\n","Processing asent: Abra began to scream with Dans voice.\n","Processing asent: He found the conduit between them by following the sluggish current of her thoughts.\n","Processing asent: He saw the stone wheel because Abra was visualizing it, but she was far too weak and disoriented to turn it.\n","Processing asent: She was using all the mental force she could muster just to keep her end of the link open.\n","Processing asent: So he could enter her mind and she could enter his.\n","Processing asent: But he was still mostly in the Suburban, with the lights of the cars headed in the other direction running across the padded roof.\n","Processing asent: Light . . . dark . . . light . . . dark.\n","Processing asent: The wheel was so heavy.\n","Processing asent: There was a sudden hammering from somewhere, and a voice.\n","Processing asent: Come out, Abra.\n","Processing asent: Times up.\n","Processing asent: We have to roll.\n","Processing asent: That frightened her, and she found a little extra strength.\n","Processing asent: The wheel began to move, pulling him deeper into the umbilicus that connected them.\n","Processing asent: It was the strangest sensation Dan had ever had in his life, exhilarating even in the horror of the situation.\n","Processing asent: Somewhere, distant, he heard Abra say, Just give me another minute, I have to change my tampon!\n","Processing asent: The roof of Johns Suburban was sliding away.\n","Processing asent: Turning away.\n","Processing asent: There was darkness, the sense of being in a tunnel, and he had time to think, If I get lost in here, Ill never be able to get back.\n","Processing asent: Ill wind up in a mental hospital somewhere, labeled a hopeless catatonic.\n","Processing asent: But then the world was sliding back into place, only it wasnt the same place.\n","Processing asent: The Suburban was gone.\n","Processing asent: He was in a smelly bathroom with dingy blue tiles on the floor and a sign beside the washbasin reading SORRY COLD WATER ONLY.\n","Processing asent: He was sitting on the toilet.\n","Processing asent: Before he could even think about getting up, the door bammed open hard enough to crack some of the old tiles, and a man strode in.\n","Processing asent: He looked about thirty-five, his hair dead black and combed away from his forehead, his face angular but handsome in a rough-hewn, bony way.\n","Processing asent: In one hand he held a pistol.\n","Processing asent: Change your tampon, sure, he said.\n","Processing asent: Whered you have it, Goldilocks, in your pants pocket?\n","Processing asent: Must have been, because your backpacks a long way from here.\n","Processing asent: (tell him I said not to call me that)\n","Processing asent: Dan said, I told you not to call me that.\n","Processing asent: Crow paused, looking at the girl sitting on the toilet seat, swaying a little from side to side.\n","Processing asent: Swaying because of the dope.\n","Processing asent: Sure.\n","Processing asent: But what about the way she sounded?\n","Processing asent: Was that because of the dope?\n","Processing asent: What happened to your voice?\n","Processing asent: You dont sound like yourself.\n","Processing asent: Dan tried to shrug the girls shoulders and only succeeded in twitching one of them.\n","Processing asent: Crow grabbed Abras arm and yanked Dan to Abras feet.\n","Processing asent: It hurt, and he cried out.\n","Processing asent: Somewheremiles from herea faint voice shouted, Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: What do I do?\n","Processing asent: Drive, he told John as Crow pulled him out the door.\n","Processing asent: Just drive.\n","Processing asent: Oh, Ill drive, all right, Crow said, and muscled Abra into the truck next to the snoring Billy Freeman.\n","Processing asent: Then he grabbed a sheaf of her hair, wound it in his fist, and pulled.\n","Processing asent: Dan screamed with Abras voice, knowing it wasnt quite her voice.\n","Processing asent: Almost, but not quite.\n","Processing asent: Crow heard the difference, but didnt know what it was.\n","Processing asent: The hat woman would have; it was the hat woman who had unwittingly shown Abra this mindswap trick.\n","Processing asent: But before we get rolling, were going to have an understanding.\n","Processing asent: No more lies, thats the understanding.\n","Processing asent: The next time you lie to your Daddy, this old geezer snoring beside me is dead meat.\n","Processing asent: I wont use the dope, either.\n","Processing asent: Ill pull in at a camp road and put a bullet in his belly.\n","Processing asent: That way it takes awhile.\n","Processing asent: Youll get to listen to him scream.\n","Processing asent: Do you understand?\n","Processing asent: Yes, Dan whispered.\n","Processing asent: Little girl, I fucking hope so, because I dont chew my cabbage twice.\n","Processing asent: Crow slammed the door and walked quickly around to the drivers side.\n","Processing asent: Dan closed Abras eyes.\n","Processing asent: He was thinking about the spoons at the birthday party.\n","Processing asent: About opening and shutting drawersthat, too.\n","Processing asent: Abra was too physically weak to grapple with the man now getting behind the wheel and starting the engine, but part of her was strong.\n","Processing asent: If he could find that part . . . the part that had moved the spoons and opened drawers and played air-music . . . the part that had written on his blackboard from miles away . . . if he could find it and then take control of it\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: As Abra had visualized a female warriors lance and a stallion, Dan now visualized a bank of switches on a control room wall.\n","Processing asent: Some worked her hands, some her legs, some the shrug of her shoulders.\n","Processing asent: Others, though, were more important.\n","Processing asent: He should be able to pull them; he had at least some of the same circuits.\n","Processing asent: The truck was moving, first reversing, then turning.\n","Processing asent: A moment later they were back on the road.\n","Processing asent: Thats right, Crow said grimly.\n","Processing asent: Go to sleep.\n","Processing asent: What the hell did you think you were going to do back there?\n","Processing asent: Jump in the toilet and flush yourself away to\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: His words faded, because here were the switches Dan was looking for.\n","Processing asent: The special switches, the ones with the red handles.\n","Processing asent: He didnt know if they were really there, and actually connected to Abras powers, or if this was just some mental game of solitaire he was playing.\n","Processing asent: He only knew that he had to try.\n","Processing asent: Shine on, he thought, and pulled them all.\n","Processing asent: Billy Freemans pickup was six or eight miles west of the gas station and rolling through rural Vermont darkness on 108 when Crow first felt the pain.\n","Processing asent: It was like a small silver band circling his left eye.\n","Processing asent: It was cold, pressing.\n","Processing asent: He reached up to touch it, but before he could, it slithered right, freezing the bridge of his nose like a shot of novocaine.\n","Processing asent: Then it circled his other eye as well.\n","Processing asent: It was like wearing metal binoculars.\n","Processing asent: Or eyecuffs.\n","Processing asent: Now his left ear began to ring, and suddenly his left cheek was numb.\n","Processing asent: He turned his head and saw the little girl looking at him.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes were wide and unblinking.\n","Processing asent: They didnt look doped in the slightest.\n","Processing asent: For that matter, they didnt look like her eyes.\n","Processing asent: They looked older.\n","Processing asent: Wiser.\n","Processing asent: And as cold as his face now felt.\n","Processing asent: (stop the truck)\n","Processing asent: Crow had capped the hypo and put it away, but he was still holding the gun hed taken from beneath the seat when he decided she was spending way too much time in the crapper.\n","Processing asent: He raised it, meaning to threaten the geezer and make her stop whatever it was she was doing, but all at once his hand felt as if it had been plunged into freezing water.\n","Processing asent: The gun put on weight: five pounds, ten pounds, what felt like twenty-five.\n","Processing asent: Twenty-five at least.\n","Processing asent: And while he was struggling to raise it, his right foot came off the F-150s gas pedal and his left hand turned the wheel so that the truck veered off the road and rolled along the soft shouldergently, slowingwith the right-side wheels tilting toward the ditch.\n","Processing asent: What are you doing to me?\n","Processing asent: What you deserve.\n","Processing asent: Daddy.\n","Processing asent: The truck bumped a downed birch tree, snapped it in two, and stopped.\n","Processing asent: The girl and the geezer were seatbelted in, but Crow had forgotten his.\n","Processing asent: He jolted forward into the steering wheel, honking the horn.\n","Processing asent: When he looked down, he saw the geezers automatic turning in his fist.\n","Processing asent: Very slowly turning toward him.\n","Processing asent: This shouldnt be happening.\n","Processing asent: The dope was supposed to stop it.\n","Processing asent: Hell, the dope had stopped it.\n","Processing asent: But something had changed in that bathroom.\n","Processing asent: Whoever was behind those eyes now was cold fucking sober.\n","Processing asent: And horribly strong.\n","Processing asent: Rose!\n","Processing asent: Rose, I need you!\n","Processing asent: I dont think she can hear, the voice that wasnt Abras said.\n","Processing asent: You may have some talents, you son of a bitch, but I dont think you have much in the way of telepathy.\n","Processing asent: I think when you want to talk to your girlfriend, you use the phone.\n","Processing asent: Exerting all his strength, Crow began to turn the Glock back toward the girl.\n","Processing asent: Now it seemed to weigh fifty pounds.\n","Processing asent: The tendons of his neck stood out like cables.\n","Processing asent: Drops of perspiration beaded on his forehead.\n","Processing asent: One ran into his eye, stinging, and Crow blinked it away.\n","Processing asent: Ill . . . shoot . . . your friend, he said.\n","Processing asent: No, the person inside Abra said.\n","Processing asent: I wont let you.\n","Processing asent: But Crow could see she was straining now, and that gave him hope.\n","Processing asent: He put everything he had into pointing the muzzle at Rip Van Winkles midsection, and had almost gotten there when the gun started to rotate back again.\n","Processing asent: Now he could hear the little bitch panting.\n","Processing asent: Hell, he was, too.\n","Processing asent: They sounded like marathoners approaching the end of a race side by side.\n","Processing asent: A car went by, not slowing.\n","Processing asent: Neither of them noticed.\n","Processing asent: They were looking at each other.\n","Processing asent: Crow brought his left hand down to join his right on the gun.\n","Processing asent: Now it turned a little more easily.\n","Processing asent: He was beating her, by God.\n","Processing asent: But his eyes!\n","Processing asent: Jesus!\n","Processing asent: Billy!\n","Processing asent: Abra shouted.\n","Processing asent: Billy, little help here!\n","Processing asent: Billy snorted.\n","Processing asent: His eyes opened.\n","Processing asent: For a moment Crow was distracted.\n","Processing asent: The force he was exerting slackened, and the gun immediately began to turn back toward him.\n","Processing asent: His hands were cold, cold.\n","Processing asent: Those metal rings were pressing into his eyes, threatening to turn them to jelly.\n","Processing asent: The gun went off for the first time when it was between them, blowing a hole in the dashboard just above the radio.\n","Processing asent: Billy jerked awake, arms flailing to either side like a man pulling himself out of a nightmare.\n","Processing asent: One of them struck Abras temple, the other Crows chest.\n","Processing asent: The cab of the truck was filled with blue haze and the smell of burnt gunpowder.\n","Processing asent: What was that?\n","Processing asent: What the hell was tha\n","Processing asent: Crow snarled, No, you bitch!\n","Processing asent: He swung the gun back toward Abra, and as he did it, he felt her control slip.\n","Processing asent: It was the blow to the head.\n","Processing asent: Crow could see dismay and terror in her eyes, and was savagely glad.\n","Processing asent: Have to kill her.\n","Processing asent: Cant give her another chance.\n","Processing asent: But not a headshot.\n","Processing asent: In the gut.\n","Processing asent: Then Ill suck the stea\n","Processing asent: Billy slammed his shoulder into Crows side.\n","Processing asent: The gun jerked up and went off again, this time putting a hole in the roof just above Abras head.\n","Processing asent: Before Crow could bring it down again, huge hands laid themselves over his.\n","Processing asent: He had time to realize that his adversary had only been tapping a fraction of the force at its command.\n","Processing asent: Panic had unlocked a great, perhaps even unknowable, reserve.\n","Processing asent: This time when the gun turned toward him, Crows wrists snapped like bundles of twigs.\n","Processing asent: For a moment he saw a single black eye staring up at him, and there was time for half a thought:\n","Processing asent: (Rose I love y)\n","Processing asent: There was a brilliant flash of white, then darkness.\n","Processing asent: Four seconds later, there was nothing left of Crow Daddy but his clothes.\n","Processing asent: Steamhead Steve, Baba the Red, Bent Dick, and Greedy G were playing a desultory game of canasta in the Bounder that Greedy and Dirty Phil shared when the shrieks began.\n","Processing asent: All four of them had been on edgethe whole True was on edgeand they dropped their cards immediately and ran for the door.\n","Processing asent: Everyone was emerging from their campers and RVs to see what the matter was, but they stopped when they saw Rose the Hat standing in the brilliant yellow-white glare of the security lights surrounding the Overlook Lodge.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes were wild.\n","Processing asent: She was pulling at her hair like an Old Testament prophet in the throes of a violent vision.\n","Processing asent: That fucking little bitch killed my Crow! she shrieked.\n","Processing asent: Ill kill her!\n","Processing asent: ILL KILL HER AND EAT HER HEART!\n","Processing asent: At last she sank to her knees, sobbing into her hands.\n","Processing asent: The True Knot stood, stunned.\n","Processing asent: No one knew what to say or do.\n","Processing asent: At last Silent Sarey went to her.\n","Processing asent: Rose shoved her violently away.\n","Processing asent: Sarey landed on her back, got up, and returned to Rose without hesitation.\n","Processing asent: This time Rose looked up and saw her would-be comforter, a woman who had also lost someone dear on this unbelievable night.\n","Processing asent: She embraced Sarey, hugging so hard that the watching True heard bones crack.\n","Processing asent: But Sarey didnt struggle, and after a few moments, the two women helped each other to their feet.\n","Processing asent: Rose looked from Silent Sarey to Big Mo, then to Heavy Mary and Token Charlie.\n","Processing asent: It was as if she had never seen any of them.\n","Processing asent: Come on, Rosie, Mo said.\n","Processing asent: Youve had a shock.\n","Processing asent: You need to lie d\n","Processing asent: She stepped away from Silent Sarey and clapped her hands to the sides of her face in a huge double slap that knocked off her hat.\n","Processing asent: She bent down to pick it up, and when she looked around at the gathered True again, some sanity had come back into her eyes.\n","Processing asent: She was thinking of Diesel Doug and the crew she had sent to meet Daddy and the girl.\n","Processing asent: I need to get hold of Deez.\n","Processing asent: Tell him and Phil and Annie to turn around.\n","Processing asent: We need to be together.\n","Processing asent: We need to take steam.\n","Processing asent: A lot of it.\n","Processing asent: Once were loaded, were going to get that bitch.\n","Processing asent: They only looked at her, their faces worried and unsure.\n","Processing asent: The sight of those frightened eyes and stupid gaping mouths infuriated her.\n","Processing asent: Do you doubt me?\n","Processing asent: Silent Sarey had crept back to her side.\n","Processing asent: Rose pushed her away from her so hard Sarey almost fell down again.\n","Processing asent: Whoever doubts me, let him step forward.\n","Processing asent: No one doubts you, Rose, Steamhead Steve said, but maybe we ought to let her alone.\n","Processing asent: He spoke carefully, and couldnt quite meet Roses eyes.\n","Processing asent: If Crows really gone, thats five dead.\n","Processing asent: Weve never lost five in one day.\n","Processing asent: Weve never even lost t\n","Processing asent: Rose stepped forward and Steve immediately stepped back, hunching his shoulders up around his ears like a child expecting a blow.\n","Processing asent: You want to run away from one little steamhead girl?\n","Processing asent: After all these years, you want to turn tail and run from a rube?\n","Processing asent: No one answered her, least of all Steve, but Rose saw the truth in their eyes.\n","Processing asent: They did.\n","Processing asent: They actually did.\n","Processing asent: Theyd had a lot of good years.\n","Processing asent: Fat years.\n","Processing asent: Easy-hunting years.\n","Processing asent: Now they had run across someone who not only had extraordinary steam but knew them for who they were and what they did.\n","Processing asent: Instead of avenging Crow Daddywho had, along with Rose, seen them through good times and badthey wanted to put their tails between their legs and go yipping away.\n","Processing asent: In that moment she wanted to kill them all.\n","Processing asent: They felt it and shuffled further back, giving her room.\n","Processing asent: All but Silent Sarey, who was staring at Rose as if hypnotized, her mouth hung on a hinge.\n","Processing asent: Rose seized her by her scrawny shoulders.\n","Processing asent: No, Rosie!\n","Processing asent: Mo squealed.\n","Processing asent: Dont hurt her!\n","Processing asent: What about you, Sarey?\n","Processing asent: That little girl was responsible for murdering the woman you loved.\n","Processing asent: Do you want to run away?\n","Processing asent: Nup, Sarey said.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes looked up into Roses.\n","Processing asent: Even now, with everyone looking at her, Sarey seemed little more than a shadow.\n","Processing asent: Do you want payback?\n","Processing asent: Lup, Sarey said.\n","Processing asent: Then: Levenge.\n","Processing asent: She had a low voice (almost a no-voice) and a speech impediment, but they all heard her, and they all knew what she was saying.\n","Processing asent: Rose looked around at the others.\n","Processing asent: For those of you who dont want what Sarey wants, who just want to get down on your bellies and squirm away\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: She turned to Big Mo and seized the womans flabby arm.\n","Processing asent: Mo screeched in fear and surprise and tried to draw away.\n","Processing asent: Rose held her in place and lifted her arm so the others could see it.\n","Processing asent: It was covered with red spots.\n","Processing asent: Can you squirm away from this?\n","Processing asent: They muttered and took another step or two back.\n","Processing asent: Rose said, Its in us.\n","Processing asent: Most of us are fine!\n","Processing asent: Sweet Terri Pickford shouted.\n","Processing asent: Im fine!\n","Processing asent: Not a mark on me!\n","Processing asent: She held her smooth arms out for inspection.\n","Processing asent: Rose turned her burning, tear-filled eyes on Terri.\n","Processing asent: Now.\n","Processing asent: But for how long?\n","Processing asent: Sweet Terri made no reply, but turned her face away.\n","Processing asent: Rose put her arm around Silent Sarey and surveyed the others.\n","Processing asent: Nut said that girl may be our only chance of getting rid of the sickness before it infects us all.\n","Processing asent: Does anyone here know better?\n","Processing asent: If you do, speak up.\n","Processing asent: No one did.\n","Processing asent: Were going to wait until Deez, Annie, and Dirty Phil get back, then well take steam.\n","Processing asent: Biggest steam ever.\n","Processing asent: Were going to empty the canisters.\n","Processing asent: Looks of surprise and more uneasy mutters greeted this.\n","Processing asent: Did they think she was crazy?\n","Processing asent: Let them.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt just measles eating into the True Knot; it was terror, and that was far worse.\n","Processing asent: When were all together, were going to circle.\n","Processing asent: Were going to grow strong.\n","Processing asent: Lodsam hanti, we are the chosen oneshave you forgotten that?\n","Processing asent: Sabbatha hanti, we are the True Knot, and we endure.\n","Processing asent: Say it with me.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes raked them.\n","Processing asent: Say it.\n","Processing asent: They said it, joining hands, making a ring.\n","Processing asent: We are the True Knot, and we endure.\n","Processing asent: A little resolution came into their eyes.\n","Processing asent: A little belief.\n","Processing asent: Only half a dozen of them were showing the spots, after all; there was still time.\n","Processing asent: Rose and Silent Sarey stepped to the circle.\n","Processing asent: Terri and Baba let go of each other to make a place for them, but Rose escorted Sarey to the center.\n","Processing asent: Under the security lights, the bodies of the two women radiated multiple shadows, like the spokes of a wheel.\n","Processing asent: When were strongwhen were one againwere going to find her and take her.\n","Processing asent: I tell you that as your leader.\n","Processing asent: And even if her steam doesnt cure the sickness thats eating us, itll be the end of the rotten\n","Processing asent: That was when the girl spoke inside her head.\n","Processing asent: Rose could not see Abra Stones angry smile, but she could feel it.\n","Processing asent: (dont bother coming to me, Rose)\n","Processing asent: In the back of John Daltons Suburban, Dan Torrance spoke four clear words in Abras voice.\n","Processing asent: Ill come to you.\n","Processing asent: Billy?\n","Processing asent: Billy!\n","Processing asent: Billy Freeman looked at the girl who didnt exactly sound like a girl.\n","Processing asent: She doubled, came together, and doubled again.\n","Processing asent: He passed a hand over his face.\n","Processing asent: His eyelids felt heavy and his thoughts seemed somehow glued together.\n","Processing asent: He couldnt make sense of this.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt daylight anymore, and they sure as hell werent on Abras street anymore.\n","Processing asent: Whos shooting?\n","Processing asent: And who took a shit in my mouth?\n","Processing asent: Christ.\n","Processing asent: Billy, you have to wake up.\n","Processing asent: You have to\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: You have to drive was what Dan meant to say, but Billy Freeman wasnt going to be driving anywhere.\n","Processing asent: Not for awhile.\n","Processing asent: His eyes were drifting shut again, the lids out of sync.\n","Processing asent: Dan threw one of Abras elbows into the old guys side and got his attention again.\n","Processing asent: For the time being, at least.\n","Processing asent: Headlights flooded the cab of the truck as another car approached.\n","Processing asent: Dan held Abras breath, but this one also went by without slowing.\n","Processing asent: Maybe a woman on her own, maybe a salesman in a hurry to get home.\n","Processing asent: A bad Samaritan, whoever it was, and bad was good for them, but they might not be lucky a third time.\n","Processing asent: Rural people tended to be neighborly.\n","Processing asent: Not to mention nosy.\n","Processing asent: Stay awake, he said.\n","Processing asent: Who are you?\n","Processing asent: Billy tried to focus on the kid, but it was impossible.\n","Processing asent: Because you sure dont sound like Abra.\n","Processing asent: Its complicated.\n","Processing asent: For now, just concentrate on staying awake.\n","Processing asent: Dan got out and walked around to the drivers side of the truck, stumbling several times.\n","Processing asent: Her legs, which had seemed so long on the day he met her, were too damned short.\n","Processing asent: He only hoped he wouldnt have enough time to get used to them.\n","Processing asent: Crows clothes were lying on the seat.\n","Processing asent: His canvas shoes were on the dirty floormat with the socks trailing out of them.\n","Processing asent: The blood and brains that had splattered his shirt and jacket had cycled out of existence, but they had left damp spots.\n","Processing asent: Dan gathered everything up and, after a moments consideration, added the gun.\n","Processing asent: He didnt want to give it up, but if they were stopped\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: He took the bundle to the front of the truck and buried it beneath a drift of old leaves.\n","Processing asent: Then he grabbed a piece of the downed birch the F-150 had struck and dragged it over the burial site.\n","Processing asent: It was hard work with Abras arms, but he managed.\n","Processing asent: He found he couldnt just step into the cab; he had to pull himself up by the steering wheel.\n","Processing asent: And once he was finally behind the wheel, her feet barely reached the pedals.\n","Processing asent: Fuck.\n","Processing asent: Billy gave a galumphing snore, and Dan threw another elbow.\n","Processing asent: Billy opened his eyes and looked around.\n","Processing asent: Where are we?\n","Processing asent: Did that guy drug me?\n","Processing asent: Then: I think I have to go back to sleep.\n","Processing asent: At some point during the final life-or-death struggle for the gun, Crows unopened bottle of Fanta had fallen to the floor.\n","Processing asent: Dan bent over, grabbed it, then paused with Abras hand on the cap, remembering what happens to soda when it takes a hard thump.\n","Processing asent: From somewhere, Abra spoke to him\n","Processing asent: and she was smiling, but it wasnt the angry smile.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought that was good.\n","Processing asent: You cant let me go to sleep, the voice coming from Dans mouth said, so John took the Fox Run exit and parked in the lot farthest from Kohls.\n","Processing asent: There he and Dave walked Dans body up and down, one on each side.\n","Processing asent: He was like a drunk at the end of a hard nightevery now and then his head sagged to his chest before snapping back up again.\n","Processing asent: Both men took a turn at asking what had happened, what was happening now, and where it was happening, but Abra only shook Dans head.\n","Processing asent: The Crow shot me in my hand before he let me go in the bathroom.\n","Processing asent: The rest is all fuzzy.\n","Processing asent: Now shh, I have to concentrate.\n","Processing asent: On the third wide circle of Johns Suburban, Dans mouth broke into a grin, and a very Abra-like giggle issued from him.\n","Processing asent: Dave looked a question at John across the body of their shambling, stumbling charge.\n","Processing asent: John shrugged and shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Oh, dear, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Soda.\n","Processing asent: Dan tilted the soda and removed the cap.\n","Processing asent: A high-pressure spray of orange pop hit Billy full in the face.\n","Processing asent: He coughed and spluttered, for the time being wide awake.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, kid!\n","Processing asent: Whyd you do that?\n","Processing asent: It worked, didnt it?\n","Processing asent: Dan handed him the still-fizzing soda.\n","Processing asent: Put the rest inside you.\n","Processing asent: Im sorry, but you cant go back to sleep, no matter how much you want to.\n","Processing asent: While Billy tilted the bottle and chugged soda, Dan leaned over and found the seat adjustment lever.\n","Processing asent: He pulled it with one hand and yanked on the steering wheel with the other.\n","Processing asent: The seat jolted forward.\n","Processing asent: It caused Billy to spill Fanta down his chin (and to utter a phrase not generally used by adults around young girls from New Hampshire), but now Abras feet could reach the pedals.\n","Processing asent: Barely.\n","Processing asent: Dan put the truck in reverse and backed up slowly, angling toward the road as he went.\n","Processing asent: When they were on the pavement, he breathed a sigh of relief.\n","Processing asent: Getting stuck in a ditch beside a little-used Vermont highway would not have advanced their cause much.\n","Processing asent: Do you know what youre doing?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Been doing it for years . . . although there was a little lag time when the state of Florida took away my license.\n","Processing asent: I was in another state at the time, but theres a little thing called reciprocity.\n","Processing asent: The bane of traveling drunks all across this great country of ours.\n","Processing asent: Youre Dan.\n","Processing asent: Guilty as charged, he said, peering over the top of the steering wheel.\n","Processing asent: He wished he had a book to sit on, but since he didnt, he would just have to do the best he could.\n","Processing asent: He dropped the transmission into drive and got rolling.\n","Processing asent: Howd you get inside her?\n","Processing asent: The Crow had said something (or only thought it, Dan didnt know which) about camp roads, and about four miles up Route 108, they came to a lane with a rustic wooden sign nailed to a pine tree: BOB AND DOTS HAPPY PLACE.\n","Processing asent: If that wasnt a camp road, nothing was.\n","Processing asent: Dan turned in, Abras arms glad for the power steering, and flicked on the high beams.\n","Processing asent: A quarter of a mile up, the lane was barred by a heavy chain with another sign hanging from it, this one less rustic: NO TRESPASSING.\n","Processing asent: The chain was good.\n","Processing asent: It meant Bob and Dot hadnt decided on a getaway weekend at their happy place, and a quarter of a mile from the highway was enough to assure them of some privacy.\n","Processing asent: There was another bonus: a culvert with water trickling out of it.\n","Processing asent: He killed the lights and engine, then turned to Billy.\n","Processing asent: See that culvert?\n","Processing asent: Go wash the soda off your face.\n","Processing asent: Splash up good.\n","Processing asent: You need to be as wide awake as you can get.\n","Processing asent: Im awake, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Not enough.\n","Processing asent: Try to keep your shirt dry.\n","Processing asent: And when youre done, comb your hair.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to have to meet the public.\n","Processing asent: Where are we?\n","Processing asent: Wheres the guy who hijacked me?\n","Processing asent: Good goddam riddance!\n","Processing asent: Billy exclaimed.\n","Processing asent: Then, after a moments thought: How about the body?\n","Processing asent: Wheres that?\n","Processing asent: An excellent question, but not one Dan wanted to answer.\n","Processing asent: What he wanted was for this to be over.\n","Processing asent: It was exhausting, and disorienting in a thousand ways.\n","Processing asent: Gone.\n","Processing asent: Thats really all you need to know.\n","Processing asent: Not now.\n","Processing asent: Wash your face, then walk up and down this road a few times.\n","Processing asent: Swing your arms, take deep breaths, and get as clear as you can.\n","Processing asent: Ive got one bitch of a headache.\n","Processing asent: Dan wasnt surprised.\n","Processing asent: When you come back, the girl is probably going to be the girl again, which means youll have to drive.\n","Processing asent: If you feel sober enough to be plausible, go to the next town that has a motel and check in.\n","Processing asent: Youre traveling with your granddaughter, got it?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: My granddaughter.\n","Processing asent: Abby Freeman.\n","Processing asent: Once youre in, call me on my cell.\n","Processing asent: Because youll be wherever . . . wherever the rest of you is.\n","Processing asent: This is fucked to the sky, buddy.\n","Processing asent: Yes, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: It certainly is.\n","Processing asent: Our job now is to unfuck it.\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: What is the next town?\n","Processing asent: No idea.\n","Processing asent: I dont want you having an accident, Billy.\n","Processing asent: If you cant get clear enough to drive twenty or thirty miles and then check into a motel without having the guy on the counter call the cops, you and Abra will have to spend the night in the cab of this truck.\n","Processing asent: It wont be comfortable, but it should be safe.\n","Processing asent: Billy opened the passenger-side door.\n","Processing asent: Give me ten minutes.\n","Processing asent: Ill be able to pass for sober.\n","Processing asent: Done it before.\n","Processing asent: He gave the girl behind the steering wheel a wink.\n","Processing asent: I work for Casey Kingsley.\n","Processing asent: Death on drinkin, remember?\n","Processing asent: Dan watched him go to the culvert and kneel there, then closed Abras eyes.\n","Processing asent: In a parking lot outside the Fox Run Mall, Abra closed Dans.\n","Processing asent: (are you awake)\n","Processing asent: (yes sort of)\n","Processing asent: (we need to turn the wheel again can you help me)\n","Processing asent: This time, she could.\n","Processing asent: Let go of me, you guys, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: His voice was his own again.\n","Processing asent: Im all right.\n","Processing asent: I think.\n","Processing asent: John and Dave let go, ready to grab him again if he staggered, but he didnt.\n","Processing asent: What he did was touch himself: hair, face, chest, legs.\n","Processing asent: Then he nodded.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, he said.\n","Processing asent: Im here.\n","Processing asent: He looked around.\n","Processing asent: Which is where?\n","Processing asent: Fox Run Mall, John said.\n","Processing asent: Sixty miles or so from Boston.\n","Processing asent: Okay, lets get back on the road.\n","Processing asent: Abra, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: What about Abra?\n","Processing asent: Abras fine.\n","Processing asent: Back where she belongs.\n","Processing asent: She belongs at home, Dave said, and with more than a touch of resentment.\n","Processing asent: In her room.\n","Processing asent: IMing with her friends or listening to those stupid Round Here kids on her iPod.\n","Processing asent: She is at home, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: If a persons body is their home, shes there.\n","Processing asent: Shes with Billy.\n","Processing asent: Billy will take care of her.\n","Processing asent: What about the one who kidnapped her?\n","Processing asent: This Crow?\n","Processing asent: Dan paused beside the back door of Johns Suburban.\n","Processing asent: You dont have to worry about him anymore.\n","Processing asent: The one we have to worry about now is Rose.\n","Processing asent: The Crown Motel was actually over the state line, in Crownville, New York.\n","Processing asent: It was a rattletrap place with a flickering sign out front reading VAC NCY and M NY CAB E CHAN ELS!\n","Processing asent: Only four cars were parked in the thirty or so slots.\n","Processing asent: The man behind the counter was a descending mountain of fat, with a ponytail that trickled to a stop halfway down his back.\n","Processing asent: He ran Billys Visa and gave him the keys to two rooms without taking his eyes from the TV, where two women on a red velvet sofa were engaged in strenuous osculation.\n","Processing asent: Do they connect?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked.\n","Processing asent: And, looking at the women: The rooms, I mean.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, yeah, they all connect, just open the doors.\n","Processing asent: He drove down the rank of units to twenty-three and twenty-four, and parked the truck.\n","Processing asent: Abra was curled up on the seat with her head pillowed on one arm, fast asleep.\n","Processing asent: Billy unlocked the rooms, turned on the lights, and opened the connecting doors.\n","Processing asent: He judged the accommodations shabby but not quite desperate.\n","Processing asent: All he wanted now was to get the two of them inside and go to sleep himself.\n","Processing asent: Preferably for about ten hours.\n","Processing asent: He rarely felt old, but tonight he felt ancient.\n","Processing asent: Abra woke up a little as he laid her on the bed.\n","Processing asent: Where are we?\n","Processing asent: Crownville, New York.\n","Processing asent: Were safe.\n","Processing asent: Ill be in the next room.\n","Processing asent: I want my dad.\n","Processing asent: And I want Dan.\n","Processing asent: Soon.\n","Processing asent: Hoping he was right about that.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes closed, then slowly opened again.\n","Processing asent: I talked to that woman.\n","Processing asent: That bitch.\n","Processing asent: Did you?\n","Processing asent: Billy had no idea what she meant.\n","Processing asent: She knows what we did.\n","Processing asent: She felt it.\n","Processing asent: And it hurt.\n","Processing asent: A harsh light gleamed momentarily in Abras eyes.\n","Processing asent: Billy thought it was like seeing a peek of sun at the end of a cold, overcast day in February.\n","Processing asent: Im glad.\n","Processing asent: Go to sleep, hon.\n","Processing asent: That cold winter light still shone out of the pale and tired face.\n","Processing asent: She knows Im coming for her.\n","Processing asent: Billy thought of brushing her hair out of her eyes, but what if she bit?\n","Processing asent: Probably that was silly, but . . . the light in her eyes.\n","Processing asent: His mother had looked like that sometimes, just before she lost her temper and whopped one of the kids.\n","Processing asent: Youll feel better in the morning.\n","Processing asent: Id like it if we could go back tonightIm sure your dad feels that way, toobut Im in no shape to drive.\n","Processing asent: I was lucky to get this far without running off the road.\n","Processing asent: I wish I could talk to my mom and dad.\n","Processing asent: Billys own mother and fathernever candidates for Parents of the Year, even at their bestwere long dead and he wished only for sleep.\n","Processing asent: He looked longingly through the open door at the bed in the other room.\n","Processing asent: Soon, but not quite yet.\n","Processing asent: He took out his cell phone and flipped it open.\n","Processing asent: It rang twice, and then he was talking to Dan.\n","Processing asent: After a few moments, he handed the phone to Abra.\n","Processing asent: Your father.\n","Processing asent: Knock yourself out.\n","Processing asent: Abra seized the phone.\n","Processing asent: Dad?\n","Processing asent: Dad?\n","Processing asent: Tears began to fill her eyes.\n","Processing asent: Yes, Im . . . stop, Dad, Im all right.\n","Processing asent: Just so sleepy I can hardly Her eyes widened as a thought struck her.\n","Processing asent: Are you okay?\n","Processing asent: She listened.\n","Processing asent: Billys eyes drifted shut and he snapped them open with an effort.\n","Processing asent: The girl was crying hard now, and he was sort of glad.\n","Processing asent: The tears had doused that light in her eyes.\n","Processing asent: She handed the phone back.\n","Processing asent: Its Dan.\n","Processing asent: He wants to talk to you again.\n","Processing asent: He took the phone and listened.\n","Processing asent: Then he said, Abra, Dan wants to know if you think there are any other bad guys.\n","Processing asent: Ones close enough to get here tonight.\n","Processing asent: I think the Crow was going to meet some others, but theyre still a long way away.\n","Processing asent: And they cant figure out where we areshe broke off for a huge yawnwithout him to tell them.\n","Processing asent: Tell Dan were safe.\n","Processing asent: And tell him to make sure my dad gets that.\n","Processing asent: Billy relayed this message.\n","Processing asent: When he ended the call, Abra was curled up on the bed, knees to chest, snoring softly.\n","Processing asent: Billy covered her with a blanket from the closet, then went to the door and ran the chain.\n","Processing asent: He considered, then propped the desk chair under the knob for good measure.\n","Processing asent: Always safe, never sorry, his father had liked to say.\n","Processing asent: Rose opened the compartment under the floor and took out one of the canisters.\n","Processing asent: Still on her knees between the EarthCruisers front seats, she cracked it and put her mouth over the hissing lid.\n","Processing asent: Her jaw unhinged all the way to her chest, and the bottom of her head became a dark hole in which a single tooth jutted.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes, ordinarily uptilted, bled downward and darkened.\n","Processing asent: Her face became a doleful deathmask with the skull standing out clear beneath.\n","Processing asent: She took steam.\n","Processing asent: When she was done, she replaced the canister and sat behind the wheel of her RV, looking straight ahead.\n","Processing asent: Dont bother coming to me, RoseIll come to you.\n","Processing asent: That was what she had said.\n","Processing asent: What she had dared to say to her, Rose OHara, Rose the Hat.\n","Processing asent: Not just strong, then; strong and vengeful.\n","Processing asent: Angry.\n","Processing asent: Come ahead, darling, she said.\n","Processing asent: And stay angry.\n","Processing asent: The angrier you are, the more foolhardy youll be.\n","Processing asent: Come and see your auntie Rose.\n","Processing asent: There was a snap.\n","Processing asent: She looked down and saw she had broken off the lower half of the EarthCruisers steering wheel.\n","Processing asent: Steam conveyed strength.\n","Processing asent: Her hands were bleeding.\n","Processing asent: Rose threw the jagged arc of plastic aside, raised her palms to her face, and began to lick them.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER SIXTEEN\n","Processing asent: THAT WHICH WAS FORGOTTEN\n","Processing asent: The moment Dan closed his phone, Dave said, Lets pick up Lucy and go get her.\n","Processing asent: Dan shook his head.\n","Processing asent: She says theyre okay, and I believe her.\n","Processing asent: Shes been drugged, though, John said.\n","Processing asent: Her judgment might not be the best right now.\n","Processing asent: She was clear enough to help me take care of the one she calls the Crow, Dan said, and I trust her on this.\n","Processing asent: Let them sleep off whatever the bastard drugged them with.\n","Processing asent: We have other things to do.\n","Processing asent: Important things.\n","Processing asent: Youve got to trust me a little here.\n","Processing asent: Youll be with your daughter soon enough, David.\n","Processing asent: For the moment, though, listen to me carefully.\n","Processing asent: Were going to drop you off at your grandmother-in-laws place.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to bring your wife to the hospital.\n","Processing asent: I dont know if shell believe me when I tell her what happened today.\n","Processing asent: I dont know how convincing I can be when I hardly believe it myself.\n","Processing asent: Tell her the story has to wait until were all together.\n","Processing asent: And that includes Abras momo.\n","Processing asent: I doubt if theyll let you in to see her.\n","Processing asent: Dave glanced at his watch.\n","Processing asent: Visiting hours are long over, and shes very ill.\n","Processing asent: Floor staff doesnt pay much attention to the visiting rules when patients are near the end, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Dave looked at John, who shrugged.\n","Processing asent: The man works in a hospice.\n","Processing asent: I think you can trust him on that.\n","Processing asent: She may not even be conscious, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Lets worry about one thing at a time.\n","Processing asent: What does Chetta have to do with this, anyway?\n","Processing asent: She doesnt know anything about it!\n","Processing asent: Dan said, Im pretty sure she knows more than you think.\n","Processing asent: They dropped Dave off at the condo on Marlborough Street and watched from the curb as he mounted the steps and rang one of the bells.\n","Processing asent: He looks like a little kid who knows hes going to the woodshed for a pants-down butt whippin, John said.\n","Processing asent: This is going to strain the hell out of his marriage, no matter how it turns out.\n","Processing asent: When a natural disaster happens, no ones to blame.\n","Processing asent: Try to make Lucy Stone see that.\n","Processing asent: Shes going to think, You left your daughter alone and a crazy guy snatched her.\n","Processing asent: On some level, shes always going to think it.\n","Processing asent: Abra might change her mind about that.\n","Processing asent: As for today, we did what we could, and so far were not doing too badly.\n","Processing asent: But its not over.\n","Processing asent: Not by a long shot.\n","Processing asent: Dave was ringing the bell again and peering into the little lobby when the elevator opened and Lucy Stone came rushing out.\n","Processing asent: Her face was strained and pale.\n","Processing asent: Dave started to talk as soon as she opened the door.\n","Processing asent: So did she.\n","Processing asent: Lucy pulled him inyanked him inby both arms.\n","Processing asent: Ah, man, John said softly.\n","Processing asent: That reminds me of too many nights when I rolled in drunk at three in the morning.\n","Processing asent: Either hell convince her or he wont, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Weve got other business.\n","Processing asent: Dan Torrance and John Dalton arrived at Massachusetts General Hospital shortly after ten thirty.\n","Processing asent: It was slack tide on the intensive care floor.\n","Processing asent: A deflating helium balloon with FEEL BETTER SOON printed on it in particolored letters drifted halfheartedly along the hallway ceiling, casting a jellyfish shadow.\n","Processing asent: Dan approached the nurses station, identified himself as a staffer at the hospice to which Ms. Reynolds was scheduled to be moved, showed his Helen Rivington House ID, and introduced John Dalton as the family doctor (a stretch, but not an actual lie).\n","Processing asent: We need to assess her condition prior to the transfer, Dan said, and two family members have asked to be present.\n","Processing asent: They are Ms. Reynoldss granddaughter and her granddaughters husband.\n","Processing asent: Im sorry about the lateness of the hour, but it was unavoidable.\n","Processing asent: Theyll be here shortly.\n","Processing asent: Ive met the Stones, the head nurse said.\n","Processing asent: Theyre lovely people.\n","Processing asent: Lucy in particular has been very attentive to her gran.\n","Processing asent: Concettas special.\n","Processing asent: Ive been reading her poems, and theyre wonderful.\n","Processing asent: But if youre expecting any input from her, gentlemen, youre going to be disappointed.\n","Processing asent: Shes slipped into a coma.\n","Processing asent: Well see about that, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: And . . . The nurse looked at John doubtfully.\n","Processing asent: Well . . . its really not my place to say\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Go on, John said.\n","Processing asent: Ive never met a head nurse who didnt know what the score was.\n","Processing asent: She smiled at him, then turned her attention back to Dan.\n","Processing asent: Ive heard wonderful things about the Rivington hospice, but I doubt very much if Concetta will be going there.\n","Processing asent: Even if she lasts until Monday, Im not sure theres any point in moving her.\n","Processing asent: It might be kinder to let her finish her journey here.\n","Processing asent: If Im stepping out of line, Im sorry.\n","Processing asent: Youre not, Dan said, and well take that into consideration.\n","Processing asent: John, would you go down to the lobby and escort the Stones up when they arrive?\n","Processing asent: I can start without you.\n","Processing asent: Are you sure\n","Processing asent: Yes, Dan said, holding his eyes.\n","Processing asent: I am.\n","Processing asent: Shes in Room Nine, the head nurse said.\n","Processing asent: Its the single at the end of the hall.\n","Processing asent: If you need me, ring her call bell.\n","Processing asent: Concettas name was on the Room 9 door, but the slot for medical orders was empty and the vitals monitor overhead showed nothing hopeful.\n","Processing asent: Dan stepped into aromas he knew well: air freshener, antiseptic, and mortal illness.\n","Processing asent: The last was a high smell that sang in his head like a violin that knows only one note.\n","Processing asent: The walls were covered with photographs, many featuring Abra at various ages.\n","Processing asent: One showed a gapemouthed cluster of little folks watching a magician pull a white rabbit from a hat.\n","Processing asent: Dan was sure it had been taken at the famous birthday party, the Day of the Spoons.\n","Processing asent: Surrounded by these pictures, a skeleton woman slept with her mouth open and a pearl rosary twined in her fingers.\n","Processing asent: Her remaining hair was so fine it almost disappeared against the pillow.\n","Processing asent: Her skin, once olive-toned, was now yellow.\n","Processing asent: The rise and fall of her thin bosom was hardly there.\n","Processing asent: One look was enough to tell Dan that the head nurse had indeed known what the score was.\n","Processing asent: If Azzie were here, he would have been curled up next to the woman in this room, waiting for Doctor Sleep to arrive so he could resume his late-night patrol of corridors empty save for the things only cats could see.\n","Processing asent: Dan sat down on the side of the bed, noting that the single IV going into her was a saline drip.\n","Processing asent: There was only one medicine that could help her now, and the hospital pharmacy didnt stock it.\n","Processing asent: Her cannula had come askew.\n","Processing asent: He straightened it.\n","Processing asent: Then he took her hand and looked into the sleeping face.\n","Processing asent: (Concetta)\n","Processing asent: There was a slight hitch in her breathing.\n","Processing asent: (Concetta come back)\n","Processing asent: Beneath the thin, bruised lids, the eyes moved.\n","Processing asent: She might have been listening; she might have been dreaming her last dreams.\n","Processing asent: Of Italy, perhaps.\n","Processing asent: Bending over the household well and hauling up a bucket of cool water.\n","Processing asent: Bending over in the hot summer sun.\n","Processing asent: (Abra needs you to come back and so do I)\n","Processing asent: It was all he could do, and he wasnt sure it would be enough until, slowly, her eyes opened.\n","Processing asent: They were vacant at first, but they gained perception.\n","Processing asent: Dan had seen this before.\n","Processing asent: The miracle of returning consciousness.\n","Processing asent: Not for the first time he wondered where it came from, and where it went when it departed.\n","Processing asent: Death was no less a miracle than birth.\n","Processing asent: The hand he was holding tightened.\n","Processing asent: The eyes remained on Dans, and Concetta smiled.\n","Processing asent: It was a timid smile, but it was there.\n","Processing asent: Oh mio caro!\n","Processing asent: Sei tu?\n","Processing asent: Sei tu?\n","Processing asent: Come e possibile?\n","Processing asent: Sei morto?\n","Processing asent: Sono morta anchio?\n","Processing asent: . . . Siamo fantasmi?\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt speak Italian, and he didnt have to.\n","Processing asent: He heard what she was saying with perfect clarity in his head.\n","Processing asent: Oh my dear one, is it you?\n","Processing asent: How can it be you?\n","Processing asent: Are you dead?\n","Processing asent: Am I?\n","Processing asent: Then, after a pause:\n","Processing asent: Are we ghosts?\n","Processing asent: Dan leaned toward her until his cheek lay against hers.\n","Processing asent: In her ear, he whispered.\n","Processing asent: In time, she whispered back.\n","Processing asent: Their conversation was short but illuminating.\n","Processing asent: Concetta spoke mostly in Italian.\n","Processing asent: At last she lifted a handit took great effort, but she managedand caressed his stubbly cheek.\n","Processing asent: She smiled.\n","Processing asent: Are you ready?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: Theres nothing to be afraid of.\n","Processing asent: S, I know that.\n","Processing asent: Im so glad you come.\n","Processing asent: Tell me again your name, signor.\n","Processing asent: Daniel Torrance.\n","Processing asent: S. You are a gift from God, Daniel Torrance.\n","Processing asent: Sei un dono di Dio.\n","Processing asent: Dan hoped it was true.\n","Processing asent: Will you give to me?\n","Processing asent: S, of course.\n","Processing asent: What you need per Abra.\n","Processing asent: And Ill give to you, Chetta.\n","Processing asent: Well drink from the well together.\n","Processing asent: She closed her eyes.\n","Processing asent: Youll go to sleep, and when you wake up\n","Processing asent: (everything will be better)\n","Processing asent: The power was even stronger than it had been on the night Charlie Hayes passed; he could feel it between them as he gently clasped her hands in his and felt the smooth pebbles of her rosary against his palms.\n","Processing asent: Somewhere, lights were being turned off, one by one.\n","Processing asent: It was all right.\n","Processing asent: In Italy a little girl in a brown dress and sandals was drawing water from the cool throat of a well.\n","Processing asent: She looked like Abra, that little girl.\n","Processing asent: The dog was barking.\n","Processing asent: Il cane.\n","Processing asent: Ginata.\n","Processing asent: Il cane si rotolava sullerba.\n","Processing asent: Barking and rolling in the grass.\n","Processing asent: Funny Ginata!\n","Processing asent: Concetta was sixteen and in love, or thirty and writing a poem at the kitchen table of a hot apartment in Queens while children shouted on the street below; she was sixty and standing in the rain and looking up at a hundred thousand lines of purest falling silver.\n","Processing asent: She was her mother and her great-granddaughter and it was time for her great change, her great voyage.\n","Processing asent: Ginata was rolling in the grass and the lights\n","Processing asent: (hurry up please)\n","Processing asent: were going out one by one.\n","Processing asent: A door was opening\n","Processing asent: (hurry up please its time)\n","Processing asent: and beyond it they could both smell all the mysterious, fragrant respiration of the night.\n","Processing asent: Above were all the stars that ever were.\n","Processing asent: He kissed her cool forehead.\n","Processing asent: Everythings all right, cara.\n","Processing asent: You only need to sleep.\n","Processing asent: Sleep will make you better.\n","Processing asent: Then he waited for her final breath.\n","Processing asent: He was still sitting there, holding her hands in his, when the door burst open and Lucy Stone came striding in.\n","Processing asent: Her husband and her daughters pediatrician followed, but not too closely; it was as if they feared being burned by the fear, fury, and confused outrage that surrounded her in a crackling aura so strong it was almost visible.\n","Processing asent: She seized Dan by the shoulder, her fingernails digging like claws into the shoulder beneath his shirt.\n","Processing asent: Get away from her.\n","Processing asent: You dont know her.\n","Processing asent: You have no more business with my grandmother than you do with my daugh\n","Processing asent: Lower your voice, Dan said without turning.\n","Processing asent: Youre in the presence of death.\n","Processing asent: The rage that had stiffened her ran out all at once, loosening her joints.\n","Processing asent: She sagged to the bed beside Dan and looked at the waxen cameo that was now her grandmothers face.\n","Processing asent: Then she looked at the haggard, beard-scruffy man who sat holding the dead hands, in which the rosary was still entwined.\n","Processing asent: Unnoticed tears began rolling down Lucys cheeks in big clear drops.\n","Processing asent: I cant make out half of what theyve been trying to tell me.\n","Processing asent: Just that Abra was kidnapped, but now shes all rightsupposedlyand shes in a motel with some man named Billy and theyre both sleeping.\n","Processing asent: All thats true, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Then spare me your holier-than-thou pronouncements, if you please.\n","Processing asent: Ill mourn my momo after I see Abra.\n","Processing asent: When Ive got my arms around her.\n","Processing asent: For now, I want to know . . . I want . . .

leaning against it.\n","Processing asent: Your name is Torrance?\n","Processing asent: Daniel Torrance?\n","Processing asent: Again that slow look from her grandmothers still profile to the man who had been present when she died.\n","Processing asent: Who are you, Mr. Torrance?\n","Processing asent: Dan let go of Chettas hands and took Lucys.\n","Processing asent: Walk with me.\n","Processing asent: Not far.\n","Processing asent: Just across the room.\n","Processing asent: She stood up without protest, still looking into his face.\n","Processing asent: He led her to the bathroom door, which was standing open.\n","Processing asent: He turned on the light and pointed to the mirror above the washbasin, where they were framed as if in a photograph.\n","Processing asent: Seen that way, there could be little doubt.\n","Processing asent: None, really.\n","Processing asent: He said, My father was your father, Lucy.\n","Processing asent: Im your half brother.\n","Processing asent: After notifying the head nurse that there had been a death on the floor, they went to the hospitals small nondenominational chapel.\n","Processing asent: Lucy knew the way; although not much of a believer, she had spent a good many hours there, thinking and remembering.\n","Processing asent: It was a comforting place to do those things, which are necessary when a loved one nears the end.\n","Processing asent: At this hour, they had it all to themselves.\n","Processing asent: First things first, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: I have to ask if you believe me.\n","Processing asent: We can do the DNA test when theres time, but . . . do we need to?\n","Processing asent: Lucy shook her head dazedly, never taking her eyes from his face.\n","Processing asent: She seemed to be trying to memorize it.\n","Processing asent: Dear Jesus.\n","Processing asent: I can hardly get my breath.\n","Processing asent: I thought you looked familiar the first time I saw you, Dave said to Dan.\n","Processing asent: Now I know why.\n","Processing asent: I would have gotten it sooner, I think, if it hadnt been . . . you know\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: So right in front of you, John said.\n","Processing asent: Dan, does Abra know?\n","Processing asent: Sure.\n","Processing asent: Dan smiled, remembering Abras theory of relativity.\n","Processing asent: She got it from your mind?\n","Processing asent: Lucy asked.\n","Processing asent: Using her telepathy thing?\n","Processing asent: No, because I didnt know.\n","Processing asent: Even someone as talented as Abra cant read something that isnt there.\n","Processing asent: But on a deeper level, we both knew.\n","Processing asent: Hell, we even said it out loud.\n","Processing asent: If anyone asked what we were doing together, we were going to say I was her uncle.\n","Processing asent: Which I am.\n","Processing asent: I should have realized consciously sooner than I did.\n","Processing asent: This is coincidence beyond coincidence, Dave said, shaking his head.\n","Processing asent: Its not.\n","Processing asent: Its the farthest thing in the world from coincidence.\n","Processing asent: Lucy, I understand that youre confused and angry.\n","Processing asent: Ill tell you everything I know, but it will take some time.\n","Processing asent: Thanks to John and your husband and Abraher most of allweve got some.\n","Processing asent: On the way, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: You can tell me on the way to Abra.\n","Processing asent: All right, Dan said, on the way.\n","Processing asent: But three hours sleep first.\n","Processing asent: She was shaking her head before he finished.\n","Processing asent: No, now.\n","Processing asent: I have to see her as soon as I possibly can.\n","Processing asent: Dont you understand?\n","Processing asent: Shes my daughter, shes been kidnapped, and I have to see her!\n","Processing asent: Shes been kidnapped, but now shes safe, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: You say that, of course you do, but you dont know.\n","Processing asent: Abra says it, he replied.\n","Processing asent: And she does know.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Mrs. StoneLucyshes asleep right now, and she needs her sleep.\n","Processing asent: I do, too.\n","Processing asent: Ive got a long trip ahead of me, and I think its going to be a hard one.\n","Processing asent: Very hard.\n","Processing asent: Lucy was looking at him closely.\n","Processing asent: Are you all right?\n","Processing asent: Just tired.\n","Processing asent: We all are, John said.\n","Processing asent: Its been . . . a stressful day.\n","Processing asent: He uttered a brief yap of laughter, then pressed both hands over his mouth like a child whos said a naughty word.\n","Processing asent: I cant even call her and hear her voice, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: She spoke slowly, as if trying to articulate a difficult precept.\n","Processing asent: Because theyre sleeping off the drugs this man . . . the one you say she calls the Crow . . . put into her.\n","Processing asent: Soon, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Youll see her soon.\n","Processing asent: He put his hand over hers.\n","Processing asent: For a moment Lucy looked as if she would shake it off.\n","Processing asent: She clasped it instead.\n","Processing asent: I can start on the way back to your grandmothers, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: He got up.\n","Processing asent: It was an effort.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: He had time to tell her how a lost man had ridden a northbound bus out of Massachusetts, and howjust over the New Hampshire state linehed tossed what would turn out to be his last bottle of booze into a trash can with IF YOU NO LONGER NEED IT, LEAVE IT HERE stenciled on the side.\n","Processing asent: He told them how his childhood friend Tony had spoken up for the first time in years when the bus had rolled into Frazier.\n","Processing asent: This is the place, Tony had said.\n","Processing asent: From there he doubled back to a time when he had been Danny instead of Dan (and sometimes doc, as in whats up, doc), and his invisible friend Tony had been an absolute necessity.\n","Processing asent: The shining was only one of the burdens that Tony helped him bear, and not the major one.\n","Processing asent: The major one was his alcoholic father, a troubled and ultimately dangerous man whom both Danny and his mother had loved deeplyperhaps as much because of his flaws as in spite of them.\n","Processing asent: He had a terrible temper, and you didnt have to be a telepath to know when it was getting the best of him.\n","Processing asent: For one thing, he was usually drunk when it happened.\n","Processing asent: I know he was loaded on the night he caught me in his study, messing with his papers.\n","Processing asent: He broke my arm.\n","Processing asent: How old were you?\n","Processing asent: Dave asked.\n","Processing asent: He was riding in the backseat with his wife.\n","Processing asent: Four, I think.\n","Processing asent: Maybe even younger.\n","Processing asent: When he was on the warpath, he had this habit of rubbing his mouth.\n","Processing asent: Danny demonstrated.\n","Processing asent: Do you know anyone else who does that when shes upset?\n","Processing asent: Abra, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: I thought she got it from me.\n","Processing asent: She raised her right hand toward her mouth, then captured it with her left and returned it to her lap.\n","Processing asent: Dan had seen Abra do exactly the same thing on the bench outside the Anniston Public Library, on the day theyd met in person for the first time.\n","Processing asent: I thought she got her temper from me, too.\n","Processing asent: I can be . . . pretty ragged sometimes.\n","Processing asent: I thought of my father the first time I saw her do the mouth-rubbing thing, Dan said, but I had other things on my mind.\n","Processing asent: So I forgot.\n","Processing asent: This made him think of Watson, the caretaker at the Overlook, who had first shown the hotels untrustworthy furnace boiler to his father.\n","Processing asent: You have to watch it, Watson had said.\n","Processing asent: Because she creeps.\n","Processing asent: But in the end, Jack Torrance had forgotten.\n","Processing asent: It was the reason Dan was still alive.\n","Processing asent: Are you telling me you figured out this family relationship from one little habit?\n","Processing asent: Thats quite a deductive leap, especially when its you and I who look alike, not you and Abrashe gets most of her looks from her father.\n","Processing asent: Lucy paused, thinking.\n","Processing asent: But of course you share another family traitDave says you call it the shining.\n","Processing asent: Thats how you knew, isnt it?\n","Processing asent: Dan shook his head.\n","Processing asent: I made a friend the year my father died.\n","Processing asent: His name was Dick Hallorann, and he was the cook at the Overlook Hotel.\n","Processing asent: He also had the shining, and he told me lots of people had a little bit of it.\n","Processing asent: He was right.\n","Processing asent: Ive met plenty of people along the way who shine to a greater or lesser degree.\n","Processing asent: Billy Freeman, for one.\n","Processing asent: Which is why hes with Abra right now.\n","Processing asent: John swung the Suburban into the little parking area behind Concettas condo, but for the time being, none of them got out.\n","Processing asent: In spite of her worry about her daughter, Lucy was fascinated by this history lesson.\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt have to look at her to know it.\n","Processing asent: If it wasnt the shining, what was it?\n","Processing asent: When we were going out to Cloud Gap on the Riv, Dave mentioned that you found a trunk in storage at Concettas building.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: My mothers.\n","Processing asent: I had no idea Momo had saved some of her things.\n","Processing asent: Dave told John and me that she was quite the party girl, back in the day.\n","Processing asent: It was actually Abra that Dave had been talking to, via telepathic link, but this was something Dan felt it might be better for his newly discovered half sister not to know, at least for the time being.\n","Processing asent: Lucy flashed Dave the reproachful look reserved for spouses who have been telling tales out of school, but said nothing.\n","Processing asent: He also said that when Alessandra dropped out of SUNY Albany, she was doing her student teaching at a prep school in Vermont or Massachusetts.\n","Processing asent: My father taught Englishuntil he lost his job for hurting a student, that isin Vermont.\n","Processing asent: At a school called Stovington Prep.\n","Processing asent: And according to my mother, he was quite the party boy in those days.\n","Processing asent: Once I knew that Abra and Billy were safe, I ran some numbers in my head.\n","Processing asent: They seemed to add up, but I felt if anyone knew for sure, it would be Alessandra Andersons mother.\n","Processing asent: Did she?\n","Processing asent: Lucy asked.\n","Processing asent: She was leaning forward now, her hands on the console between the front seats.\n","Processing asent: Not everything, and we didnt have long together, but she knew enough.\n","Processing asent: She didnt remember the name of the school where your mother student-taught, but she knew it was in Vermont.\n","Processing asent: And that shed had a brief affair with her supervising teacher.\n","Processing asent: Who was, she said, a published writer.\n","Processing asent: Dan paused.\n","Processing asent: My father was a published writer.\n","Processing asent: Only a few stories, but some of them were in very good magazines, like the Atlantic Monthly.\n","Processing asent: Concetta never asked her for the mans name, and Alessandra never volunteered it, but if her college transcript is in that trunk, Im pretty sure youll find that her supervisor was John Edward Torrance.\n","Processing asent: He yawned and looked at his watch.\n","Processing asent: Thats all I can do right now.\n","Processing asent: Lets go upstairs.\n","Processing asent: Three hours sleep for all of us, then on to upstate New York.\n","Processing asent: The roads will be empty, and we should be able to make great time.\n","Processing asent: Do you swear shes safe?\n","Processing asent: Lucy asked.\n","Processing asent: Dan nodded.\n","Processing asent: All right, Ill wait.\n","Processing asent: But only for three hours.\n","Processing asent: As for sleeping . . . She laughed.\n","Processing asent: The sound had no humor in it.\n","Processing asent: When they entered Concettas condo, Lucy strode directly to the microwave in the kitchen, set the timer, and showed it to Dan.\n","Processing asent: He nodded, then yawned again.\n","Processing asent: Three thirty a.m., were out of here.\n","Processing asent: She studied him gravely.\n","Processing asent: Id like to go without you, you know.\n","Processing asent: Right this minute.\n","Processing asent: He smiled a little.\n","Processing asent: I think you better hear the rest of the story first.\n","Processing asent: She nodded grimly.\n","Processing asent: That and the fact that my daughter needs to sleep off whatever is in her system are the only things holding me here.\n","Processing asent: Now go lie down before you fall down.\n","Processing asent: Dan and John took the guest room.\n","Processing asent: The wallpaper and furnishings made it clear that it had been mostly kept for one special little girl, but Chetta must have had other guests from time to time, because there were twin beds.\n","Processing asent: As they lay in the dark, John said: Its not a coincidence that this hotel you stayed in as a child is also in Colorado, is it?\n","Processing asent: This True Knot is in the same town?\n","Processing asent: And the hotel was haunted?\n","Processing asent: The ghostie people, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Then John said something that surprised Dan and temporarily brought him back from the edge of sleep.\n","Processing asent: Dave had been rightthe easiest things to miss were the ones right in front of you.\n","Processing asent: It makes sense, I suppose . . . once you accept the idea there could be supernatural beings among us and feeding on us.\n","Processing asent: An evil place would call evil creatures.\n","Processing asent: Theyd feel right at home there.\n","Processing asent: Do you suppose this Knot has other places like that, in other parts of the country?\n","Processing asent: Other . . . I dont know . . . cold spots?\n","Processing asent: Im sure they do.\n","Processing asent: Dan put an arm over his eyes.\n","Processing asent: His body ached and his head was pounding.\n","Processing asent: Johnny, Id love to do the boys-having-a-sleepover thing with you, but I have to get some shuteye.\n","Processing asent: Okay, but . . . John got up on one elbow.\n","Processing asent: All things being equal, you would have gone right from the hospital, like Lucy wanted.\n","Processing asent: Because you care almost as much about Abra as they do.\n","Processing asent: You think shes safe, but you could be wrong.\n","Processing asent: Im not.\n","Processing asent: Hoping that was the truth.\n","Processing asent: He had to hope so, because the simple fact was that he couldnt go, not now.\n","Processing asent: If it had only been to New York, maybe.\n","Processing asent: But it wasnt, and he had to sleep.\n","Processing asent: His whole body cried for it.\n","Processing asent: Whats wrong with you, Dan?\n","Processing asent: Because you look terrible.\n","Processing asent: Nothing.\n","Processing asent: Just tired.\n","Processing asent: Then he was gone, first into darkness and then into a confused nightmare of running down endless halls while some Shape followed him, swinging a mallet from side to side, splitting wallpaper and driving up puffs of plaster dust.\n","Processing asent: Come out, you little shit! the Shape yelled.\n","Processing asent: Come out, you worthless pup, and take your medicine!\n","Processing asent: Then Abra was with him.\n","Processing asent: They were sitting on the bench in front of the Anniston Public Library, in the late-summer sun.\n","Processing asent: She was holding his hand.\n","Processing asent: Its all right, Uncle Dan.\n","Processing asent: Its all right.\n","Processing asent: Before he died, your father turned that Shape out.\n","Processing asent: You dont have to\n","Processing asent: The library door banged open and a woman stepped into the sunlight.\n","Processing asent: Great clouds of dark hair billowed around her head, yet her jauntily cocked tophat stayed on.\n","Processing asent: It stayed on like magic.\n","Processing asent: Oh, look, she said.\n","Processing asent: Its Dan Torrance, the man who stole a womans money while she was sleeping one off and then left her kid to be beaten to death.\n","Processing asent: She smiled at Abra, revealing a single tooth.\n","Processing asent: It looked as long and sharp as a bayonet.\n","Processing asent: What will he do to you, little sweetie?\n","Processing asent: What will he do to you?\n","Processing asent: Lucy woke him promptly at three thirty, but shook her head when Dan moved to wake John.\n","Processing asent: Let him sleep a bit longer.\n","Processing asent: And my husband is snoring on the couch.\n","Processing asent: She actually smiled.\n","Processing asent: It makes me think of the Garden of Gethsemane, you know.\n","Processing asent: Jesus reproaching Peter, saying, So you could not watch with me even one hour?\n","Processing asent: Or something like that.\n","Processing asent: But I have no reason to reproach David, I guesshe saw it, too.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Ive made scrambled eggs.\n","Processing asent: You look like you could use some.\n","Processing asent: Youre skinny as a rail.\n","Processing asent: She paused and added: Brother.\n","Processing asent: Dan wasnt particularly hungry, but he followed her into the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: Saw what, too?\n","Processing asent: I was going through Momos papersanything to keep my hands busy and pass the timeand I heard a clunk from the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: She took his hand and led him to the counter between the stove and the fridge.\n","Processing asent: There was a row of old-fashioned apothecary jars here, and the one containing sugar had been overturned.\n","Processing asent: A message had been written in the spill.\n","Processing asent: Going back to sleep\n","Processing asent: In spite of how he felt, Dan thought of his blackboard and had to smile.\n","Processing asent: It was so perfectly Abra.\n","Processing asent: She must have woken up just enough to do that, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Dont think so, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: She looked at him from the stove, where she was dishing up scrambled eggs.\n","Processing asent: You woke her up.\n","Processing asent: She heard your worry.\n","Processing asent: Do you really believe that?\n","Processing asent: Sit down.\n","Processing asent: She paused.\n","Processing asent: Sit down, Dan.\n","Processing asent: I guess I better get used to calling you that.\n","Processing asent: Sit down and eat.\n","Processing asent: Dan wasnt hungry, but he needed the fuel.\n","Processing asent: He did as she said.\n","Processing asent: She sat across from him, sipping a glass of juice from the last carafe Concetta Reynolds would ever have delivered from Dean & DeLuca.\n","Processing asent: Older man with booze issues, starstruck younger woman.\n","Processing asent: Thats the picture Im getting.\n","Processing asent: Its the one I got, too.\n","Processing asent: Dan shoveled the eggs in steadily and methodically, not tasting them.\n","Processing asent: Coffee, Mr. . . . Dan?\n","Processing asent: She went past the spilled sugar to the Bunn.\n","Processing asent: Hes married, but his job takes him to a lot of faculty parties where there are a lot of pretty young gals.\n","Processing asent: Not to mention a fair amount of blooming libido when the hour gets late and the music gets loud.\n","Processing asent: Sounds about right, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Maybe my mom used to go along to those parties, but then there was a kid to take care of at home and no money for babysitters.\n","Processing asent: She passed him a cup of coffee.\n","Processing asent: He sipped it black before she could ask what he took in it.\n","Processing asent: Thanks.\n","Processing asent: Anyway, they had a thing.\n","Processing asent: Probably at one of the local motels.\n","Processing asent: It sure wasnt in the back of his carwe had a VW Bug.\n","Processing asent: Even a couple of horny acrobats couldnt have managed that.\n","Processing asent: Blackout screwing, John said, coming into the room.\n","Processing asent: His hair was standing up in sleep-quills at the back of his head.\n","Processing asent: Thats what the oldtimers call it.\n","Processing asent: Are there any more of those eggs?\n","Processing asent: Plenty, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Abra left a message on the counter.\n","Processing asent: Really?\n","Processing asent: John went to look at it.\n","Processing asent: That was her?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Id know her printing anywhere.\n","Processing asent: Holy

Sleeping Beauty in there on the couch.\n","Processing asent: She sat down.\n","Processing asent: Go on, Dan.\n","Processing asent: I dont know if she thought my dad would leave my mom for her or not, and I doubt if youll find the answer to that one in her trunk.\n","Processing asent: Unless maybe she left a diary.\n","Processing asent: All I knowbased on what Dave said and what Concetta told me lateris that she hung around for awhile.\n","Processing asent: Maybe hoping, maybe just partying, maybe both.\n","Processing asent: But by the time she found out she was pregnant, she must have given up.\n","Processing asent: For all I know, we might have been in Colorado by then.\n","Processing asent: Do you suppose your mother ever found out?\n","Processing asent: I dont know, but she must have wondered how faithful he was, especially on the nights when he came in late and shitfaced.\n","Processing asent: Im sure she knew that drunks dont limit their bad behavior to betting the ponies or tucking five-spots into the cleavages of the waitresses down at the Twist and Shout.\n","Processing asent: She put a hand on his arm.\n","Processing asent: Are you all right?\n","Processing asent: You look exhausted.\n","Processing asent: Im okay.\n","Processing asent: But youre not the only one whos trying to process all this.\n","Processing asent: She died in a car accident, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: She had turned from Dan and was looking fixedly at the bulletin board on the fridge.\n","Processing asent: In the middle was a photograph of Concetta and Abra, who looked about four, walking hand in hand through a field of daisies.\n","Processing asent: The man with her was a lot older.\n","Processing asent: And drunk.\n","Processing asent: They were going fast.\n","Processing asent: Momo didnt want to tell me, but around the time I turned eighteen, I got curious and nagged her into giving me at least some of the details.\n","Processing asent: When I asked if my mother was drunk, too, Chetta said she didnt know.\n","Processing asent: She said the police have no reason to test passengers who are killed in fatal accidents, only the driver.\n","Processing asent: She sighed.\n","Processing asent: It doesnt matter.\n","Processing asent: Well leave the family stories for another day.\n","Processing asent: Tell me whats happened to my daughter.\n","Processing asent: He did.\n","Processing asent: At some point, he turned around and saw Dave Stone standing in the doorway, tucking his shirt into his pants and watching him.\n","Processing asent: Dan started with how Abra had gotten in touch with him, first using Tony as a kind of intermediary.\n","Processing asent: Then how Abra had come in contact with the True Knot: a nightmare vision of the one she called the baseball boy.\n","Processing asent: I remember that nightmare, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: She woke me up, screaming.\n","Processing asent: It had happened before, but it was the first time in two or three years.\n","Processing asent: Dave frowned.\n","Processing asent: I dont remember that at all.\n","Processing asent: You were in Boston, at a conference.\n","Processing asent: She turned to Dan.\n","Processing asent: Let me see if Ive got this.\n","Processing asent: These people arent people, theyre . . . what?\n","Processing asent: Some kind of vampires?\n","Processing asent: In a way, I suppose.\n","Processing asent: They dont sleep in coffins during the day or turn into bats by moonlight, and I doubt if crosses and garlic bother them, but theyre parasites, and theyre certainly not human.\n","Processing asent: Human beings dont disappear when they die, John said flatly.\n","Processing asent: You really saw that happen?\n","Processing asent: We did.\n","Processing asent: All three of us.\n","Processing asent: In any case, Dan said, the True Knot isnt interested in ordinary children, only those who have the shining.\n","Processing asent: Children like Abra, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: They torture them before killing themto purify the steam, Abra says.\n","Processing asent: I keep picturing moonshiners making white lightning.\n","Processing asent: They want to . . . inhale her, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Still trying to get it straight in her head.\n","Processing asent: Because she has the shining.\n","Processing asent: Not just the shining, but a great shining.\n","Processing asent: Im a flashlight.\n","Processing asent: Shes a lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: And she knows about them.\n","Processing asent: She knows what they are.\n","Processing asent: Theres more, John said.\n","Processing asent: What we did to those men at Cloud Gap . . . as far as this Rose is concerned, thats down to Abra, no matter who actually did the killing.\n","Processing asent: What else could she expect?\n","Processing asent: Lucy asked indignantly.\n","Processing asent: Dont they understand self-defense?\n","Processing asent: Survival?\n","Processing asent: What Rose understands, Dan said, is that theres a little girl who has challenged her.\n","Processing asent: Challenged?\n","Processing asent: Abra got in touch telepathically.\n","Processing asent: She told Rose that she was coming after her.\n","Processing asent: That temper of hers, Dave said quietly.\n","Processing asent: Ive told her a hundred times it would get her in trouble.\n","Processing asent: Shes not going anywhere near that woman, or her child-killing friends, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought: Yes . . . and no.\n","Processing asent: He took Lucys hand.\n","Processing asent: She started to pull away, then didnt.\n","Processing asent: The thing you have to understand is really quite simple, he said.\n","Processing asent: They will never stop.\n","Processing asent: No buts, Lucy.\n","Processing asent: Under other circumstances, Rose still might have decided to disengagethis is one crafty old she-wolfbut theres one other factor.\n","Processing asent: Theyre sick, John said.\n","Processing asent: Abra says its the measles.\n","Processing asent: They might even have caught it from the Trevor boy.\n","Processing asent: I dont know if youd call that divine retribution or just irony.\n","Processing asent: I know it doesnt sound like much, but believe me, it is.\n","Processing asent: You know how, in the old days, measles could run through a whole family of kids?\n","Processing asent: If thats happening to this True Knot, it could wipe them out.\n","Processing asent: Good!\n","Processing asent: Lucy cried.\n","Processing asent: The angry smile on her face was one Dan knew well.\n","Processing asent: Not if they think Abras supersteam will cure them, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Thats what you need to understand, hon.\n","Processing asent: This isnt just a skirmish.\n","Processing asent: To this bitch its a fight to the death.\n","Processing asent: He struggled and then brought out the rest of it.\n","Processing asent: Because it had to be said.\n","Processing asent: If Rose gets the chance, shell eat our daughter alive.\n","Processing asent: Lucy asked, Where are they?\n","Processing asent: This True Knot, where are they?\n","Processing asent: Colorado, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: At a place called the Bluebell Campground in the town of Sidewinder.\n","Processing asent: That the site of the campground was the very place where he had once almost died at his fathers hands was a thing he didnt want to say, because it would lead to more questions and more cries of coincidence.\n","Processing asent: The one thing of which Dan was sure was that there were no coincidences.\n","Processing asent: This Sidewinder must have a police department, Lucy said.\n","Processing asent: Well call them and get them on this.\n","Processing asent: By telling them what?\n","Processing asent: Johns tone was gentle, nonargumentative.\n","Processing asent: Well . . . that\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: If you actually got the cops to go up there to the campground, Dan said, theyd find nothing but a bunch of middle-aged-going-on-older Americans.\n","Processing asent: Harmless RV folks, the kind who always want to show you pictures of their grandkids.\n","Processing asent: Their papers would all be in apple-pie order, from dog licenses to land deeds.\n","Processing asent: The police wouldnt find guns if they managed to get a search warrantwhich they wouldnt, no probable causebecause the True Knot doesnt need guns.\n","Processing asent: Their weapons are up here.\n","Processing asent: Dan tapped his forehead.\n","Processing asent: Youd be the crazy lady from New Hampshire, Abra would be your crazy daughter who ran away from home, and wed be your crazy friends.\n","Processing asent: Lucy pressed her palms to her temples.\n","Processing asent: I cant believe this is happening.\n","Processing asent: If you did a search of records, I think youd find that the True Knotunder whatever name they might be incorporatedhas been very generous to that particular Colorado town.\n","Processing asent: You dont shit in your nest, you feather it.\n","Processing asent: Then, if bad times come, you have lots of friends.\n","Processing asent: These bastards have been around a long time, John said.\n","Processing asent: Havent they?\n","Processing asent: Because the main thing they take from this steam is longevity.\n","Processing asent: Im pretty sure thats right, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: And as good Americans, Im sure theyve been busy making money the whole time.\n","Processing asent: Enough to grease wheels a lot bigger than the ones that turn in Sidewinder.\n","Processing asent: State wheels.\n","Processing asent: Federal wheels.\n","Processing asent: And this Rose . . . shell never stop.\n","Processing asent: Dan was thinking of the precognitive vision hed had of her.\n","Processing asent: The cocked hat.\n","Processing asent: The yawning mouth.\n","Processing asent: The single tooth.\n","Processing asent: Her heart is set on your daughter.\n","Processing asent: A woman who stays alive by killing children has no heart, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Oh, she has one, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: But its black.\n","Processing asent: Lucy stood up.\n","Processing asent: No more talking.\n","Processing asent: I want to go to her now.\n","Processing asent: Everybody use the bathroom, because once we leave, were not stopping until we get to that motel.\n","Processing asent: Dan said, Does Concetta have a computer?\n","Processing asent: If she does, I need to take a quick peek at something before we go.\n","Processing asent: Lucy sighed.\n","Processing asent: Its in her study, and I think you can guess the password.\n","Processing asent: But if you take more than five minutes, were going without you.\n","Processing asent: Rose lay awake in her bed, stiff as a poker, trembling with steam and fury.\n","Processing asent: When an engine started up at quarter past two, she heard it.\n","Processing asent: Steamhead Steve and Baba the Russian.\n","Processing asent: When another started at twenty till four, she heard that one, too.\n","Processing asent: This time it was the Little twins, Pea and Pod.\n","Processing asent: Sweet Terri Pickford was with them, no doubt looking nervously through the back window for any sign of Rose.\n","Processing asent: Big Mo had asked to go alongbegged to go alongbut they had turned her down because Mo was carrying the disease.\n","Processing asent: Rose could have stopped them, but why bother?\n","Processing asent: Let them discover what life was like in America on their own, with no True Knot to protect them in camp or watch their backs while they were on the road.\n","Processing asent: Especially when I tell Toady Slim to kill their credit cards and empty their rich bank accounts, she thought.\n","Processing asent: Toady was no Jimmy Numbers, but he could still take care of it, and at the touch of a button.\n","Processing asent: And hed be there to do it.\n","Processing asent: Toady would stick.\n","Processing asent: So would all the good ones . . . or almost all the good ones.\n","Processing asent: Dirty Phil, Apron Annie, and Diesel Doug were no longer on their way back.\n","Processing asent: They had taken a vote and decided to head south instead.\n","Processing asent: Deez had told them Rose was no longer to be trusted, and besides, it was long past time to cut the Knot.\n","Processing asent: Good luck with that, darling boy, she thought, clenching and unclenching her fists.\n","Processing asent: Splitting the True was a terrible idea, but thinning the herd was a good one.\n","Processing asent: So let the weaklings run and the sicklings die.\n","Processing asent: When the bitchgirl was also dead and they had swallowed her steam (Rose had no more illusions of keeping her prisoner), the twenty-five or so who were left would be stronger than ever.\n","Processing asent: She mourned Crow, and knew she had no one who could step into his shoes, but Token Charlie would do the best he could.\n","Processing asent: So would Harpman Sam . . . Bent Dick . . . Fat Fannie and Long Paul . . . Greedy G, not the brightest bulb, but loyal and unquestioning.\n","Processing asent: Besides, with the others gone, the steam she still had in storage would go farther and make them stronger.\n","Processing asent: They would need to be strong.\n","Processing asent: Come to me, little bitchgirl, Rose thought.\n","Processing asent: See how strong you are when there are two dozen against you.\n","Processing asent: See how you like it when its just you against the True.\n","Processing asent: Well eat your steam and lap up your blood.\n","Processing asent: But first, well drink your screams.\n","Processing asent: Rose stared up into the darkness, hearing the fading voices of the runners, the faithless ones.\n","Processing asent: At the door came a soft, timid knock.\n","Processing asent: Rose lay silent for a moment or two, considering, then swung her legs out of bed.\n","Processing asent: She was naked but made no attempt to cover herself when Silent Sarey crept in, shapeless inside one of her flannel nightgowns, her mouse-colored bangs covering her brows and almost hanging in her eyes.\n","Processing asent: As always, Sarey seemed hardly there even when she was.\n","Processing asent: Im sad, Loze.\n","Processing asent: I know you are.\n","Processing asent: Im sad, too.\n","Processing asent: She wasntshe was furiousbut it sounded good.\n","Processing asent: I miss Andi.\n","Processing asent: Andi, yesrube name Andrea Steiner, whose father had fucked the humanity out of her long before the True Knot had found her.\n","Processing asent: Rose remembered watching her that day in the movie theater, and how, later, she had fought her way through the Turning with sheer guts and willpower.\n","Processing asent: Snakebite Andi would have stuck.\n","Processing asent: Snake would have walked through fire, if Rose said the True Knot needed her to.\n","Processing asent: She held out her arms.\n","Processing asent: Sarey scurried to her and laid her head against Roses breast.\n","Processing asent: Wivvout her I lunt to die.\n","Processing asent: No, honey, I dont think so.\n","Processing asent: Rose pulled the little thing into bed and hugged her tight.\n","Processing asent: She was nothing but a rack of bones held together by scant meat.\n","Processing asent: Tell me what you really want.\n","Processing asent: Beneath the shaggy bangs, two eyes gleamed, feral.\n","Processing asent: Levenge.\n","Processing asent: Rose kissed one cheek, then the other, then the thin dry lips.\n","Processing asent: She drew back a little and said, Yes.\n","Processing asent: And youll have it.\n","Processing asent: Open your mouth, Sarey.\n","Processing asent: Sarey obediently did so.\n","Processing asent: Their lips came together again.\n","Processing asent: Rose the Hat, still full of steam, breathed down Silent Sareys throat.\n","Processing asent: The walls of Concettas study were papered with memos, fragments of poems, and correspondence that would never be answered.\n","Processing asent: Dan typed in the four-letter password, launched Firefox, and googled the Bluebell Campground.\n","Processing asent: They had a website that wasnt terribly informative, probably because the owners didnt care that much about attracting visitors; the place was your basic front.\n","Processing asent: But there were photos of the property, and these Dan studied with the fascination people reserve for recently discovered old family albums.\n","Processing asent: The Overlook was long gone, but he recognized the terrain.\n","Processing asent: Once, just before the first of the snowstorms that closed them in for the winter, he and his mother and father had stood together on the hotels broad front porch (seeming even broader with the lawn gliders and wicker furniture in storage), looking down the long, smooth slope of the front lawn.\n","Processing asent: At the bottom, where the deer and the antelope often came out to play, there was now a long rustic building called the Overlook Lodge.\n","Processing asent: Here, the caption said, visitors could dine, play bingo, and dance to live music on Friday and Saturday nights.\n","Processing asent: On Sundays there were church services, overseen by a rotating cadre of Sidewinders men and women of the cloth.\n","Processing asent: Until the snow came, my father mowed that lawn and trimmed the topiary that used to be there.\n","Processing asent: He said hed trimmed lots of ladies topiaries in his time.\n","Processing asent: I didnt get the joke, but it used to make Mom laugh.\n","Processing asent: Some joke, he said, low.\n","Processing asent: He saw rows of sparkling RV hookups, lux mod cons that supplied LP gas as well as electricity.\n","Processing asent: There were mens and womens shower buildings big enough to service mega-truckstops like Little America or Pedros South of the Border.\n","Processing asent: There was a playground for the wee folks.\n","Processing asent: (Dan wondered if the kiddies who played there ever saw or sensed unsettling things, as Danny Doc Torrance once had in the Overlooks playground.)\n","Processing asent: There was a softball field, a shuffleboard area, a couple of tennis courts, even bocce.\n","Processing asent: No roque, thoughnot that.\n","Processing asent: Not anymore.\n","Processing asent: Halfway up the slopewhere the Overlooks hedge animals had once congregatedthere was a row of clean white satellite dishes.\n","Processing asent: At the crest of the hill, where the hotel itself had stood, was a wooden platform with a long flight of steps leading up to it.\n","Processing asent: This site, now owned and administered by the State of Colorado, was identified as Roof O the World.\n","Processing asent: Visitors to the Bluebell Campground were welcome to use it, or to hike the trails beyond, free of charge.\n","Processing asent: The trails are recommended only for the more experienced hiker, the caption read, but Roof O the World is for everyone.\n","Processing asent: The views are spectacular!\n","Processing asent: Dan was sure they were.\n","Processing asent: Certainly they had been spectacular from the dining room and ballroom of the Overlook . . . at least until the steadily mounting snow blocked off the windows.\n","Processing asent: To the west were the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains, sawing at the sky like spears.\n","Processing asent: To the east, you could see all the way to Boulder.\n","Processing asent: Hell, all the way to Denver and Arvada on rare days when the pollution wasnt too bad.\n","Processing asent: The state had taken that particular piece of land, and Dan wasnt surprised.\n","Processing asent: Who would have wanted to build there?\n","Processing asent: The ground was rotten, and he doubted if you had to be telepathic to sense it.\n","Processing asent: But the True had gotten as close as it could, and Dan had an idea that their wandering gueststhe normal onesrarely came back for a second visit, or recommended the Bluebell to their friends.\n","Processing asent: An evil place would call evil creatures, John had said.\n","Processing asent: If so, the converse would also be true: it would tend to repel good ones.\n","Processing asent: Dan?\n","Processing asent: Dave called.\n","Processing asent: Bus is leaving.\n","Processing asent: I need another minute!\n","Processing asent: He closed his eyes and propped the heel of his palm against his forehead.\n","Processing asent: His voice awoke her at once.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n","Processing asent: It was dark outside the Crown Motel, dawn still an hour or more away, when the door of unit 24 opened and a girl stepped out.\n","Processing asent: Heavy fog had moved in, and the world was hardly there at all.\n","Processing asent: The girl was wearing black pants and a white shirt.\n","Processing asent: She had put her hair up in pigtails, and the face they framed looked very young.\n","Processing asent: She breathed deeply, the coolness and the hanging moisture in the air doing wonders for her lingering headache but not much for her unhappy heart.\n","Processing asent: Momo was dead.\n","Processing asent: Yet, if Uncle Dan was right, not really dead; just somewhere else.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps a ghostie person; perhaps not.\n","Processing asent: In any case, it wasnt a thing she could spend time thinking about.\n","Processing asent: Later, perhaps, she would meditate on these matters.\n","Processing asent: Dan had asked if Billy was asleep.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she had told him, still fast asleep.\n","Processing asent: Through the open door she could see Mr. Freemans feet and legs under the blankets and hear his steady snoring.\n","Processing asent: He sounded like an idling motorboat.\n","Processing asent: Dan had asked if Rose or any of the others had tried to touch her mind.\n","Processing asent: She would have known.\n","Processing asent: Her traps were set.\n","Processing asent: Rose would guess that.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt stupid.\n","Processing asent: He had asked if there was a telephone in her room.\n","Processing asent: Yes, there was a phone.\n","Processing asent: Uncle Dan told her what he wanted her to do.\n","Processing asent: It was pretty simple.\n","Processing asent: The scary part was what she had to say to the strange woman in Colorado.\n","Processing asent: And yet she wanted to.\n","Processing asent: Part of her had wanted that ever since shed heard the baseball boys dying screams.\n","Processing asent: (you understand the word you have to keep saying?)\n","Processing asent: Yes, of course.\n","Processing asent: (because you have to goad her do you know what that)\n","Processing asent: (yes I know what it means)\n","Processing asent: Make her mad.\n","Processing asent: Infuriate her.\n","Processing asent: Abra stood breathing into the fog.\n","Processing asent: The road theyd driven in on was nothing but a scratch, the trees on the other side completely gone.\n","Processing asent: So was the motel office.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes she wished she was like that, all white on the inside.\n","Processing asent: But only sometimes.\n","Processing asent: In her deepest heart, she had never regretted what she was.\n","Processing asent: When she felt readyas ready as she could beAbra went back into her room and closed the door on her side so she wouldnt disturb Mr. Freeman if she had to talk loud.\n","Processing asent: She examined the instructions on the phone, pushed 9 to get an outside line, then dialed directory assistance and asked for the number of the Overlook Lodge at the Bluebell Campground, in Sidewinder, Colorado.\n","Processing asent: I could give you the main number, Dan had said, but youd only get an answering machine.\n","Processing asent: In the place where the guests ate meals and played games, the telephone rang for a long time.\n","Processing asent: Dan said it probably would, and that she should just wait it out.\n","Processing asent: It was, after all, two hours earlier there.\n","Processing asent: At last a grumpy voice said, Hello?\n","Processing asent: If you want the office, you called the wrong num\n","Processing asent: I dont want the office, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: She hoped the rapid heavy beating of her heart wasnt audible in her voice.\n","Processing asent: I want Rose.\n","Processing asent: Rose the Hat.\n","Processing asent: A pause.\n","Processing asent: Then: Who is this?\n","Processing asent: Abra Stone.\n","Processing asent: You know my name, dont you?\n","Processing asent: Im the girl shes looking for.\n","Processing asent: Tell her Ill call back in five minutes.\n","Processing asent: If shes there, well talk.\n","Processing asent: If shes not, tell her she can go fuck herself.\n","Processing asent: I wont call back again.\n","Processing asent: Abra hung up, then lowered her head, cupped her burning face in her palms, and took long deep breaths.\n","Processing asent: Rose was drinking coffee behind the wheel of her EarthCruiser, her feet on the secret compartment with the stored canisters of steam inside, when the knock came at her door.\n","Processing asent: A knock this early could only mean more trouble.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she said.\n","Processing asent: Come in.\n","Processing asent: It was Long Paul, wearing a robe over childish pajamas with racing cars on them.\n","Processing asent: The pay phone in the Lodge started ringing.\n","Processing asent: At first I let it go, thought it was a wrong number, and besides, I was making coffee in the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: But it kept on, so I answered.\n","Processing asent: It was that girl.\n","Processing asent: She wanted to talk to you.\n","Processing asent: She said shed call back in five minutes.\n","Processing asent: Silent Sarey sat up in bed, blinking through her bangs, the covers clutched around her shoulders like a shawl.\n","Processing asent: Go, Rose told her.\n","Processing asent: Sarey did so, without a word.\n","Processing asent: Rose watched through the EarthCruisers wide windshield as Sarey trudged barefooted back to the Bounder she had shared with Snake.\n","Processing asent: That girl.\n","Processing asent: Instead of running and hiding, the bitchgirl was making telephone calls.\n","Processing asent: Talk about brassbound nerve.\n","Processing asent: Her own idea?\n","Processing asent: That was a little hard to believe, wasnt it?\n","Processing asent: What were you doing up and bustling in the kitchen so early?\n","Processing asent: I couldnt sleep.\n","Processing asent: She turned toward him.\n","Processing asent: Just a tall, elderly fellow with thinning hair and bifocals sitting at the end of his nose.\n","Processing asent: A rube could pass him on the street every day for a year without seeing him, but he wasnt without certain abilities.\n","Processing asent: Paul didnt have Snakes sleeper talent, or the late Grampa Flicks locator talent, but he was a decent persuader.\n","Processing asent: If he happened to suggest that a rube slap his wifes faceor a strangers, for that matterthat face would be slapped, and briskly.\n","Processing asent: Everyone in the True had their little skills; it was how they got along.\n","Processing asent: Let me see your arms, Paulie.\n","Processing asent: He sighed and brushed the sleeves of his robe and pajamas up to his wrinkly elbows.\n","Processing asent: The red spots were there.\n","Processing asent: When did they break?\n","Processing asent: Saw the first couple yesterday afternoon.\n","Processing asent: Yuh.\n","Processing asent: Some.\n","Processing asent: She gazed into his honest, trusting eyes and felt like hugging him.\n","Processing asent: Some had run, but Long Paul was still here.\n","Processing asent: So were most of the others.\n","Processing asent: Surely enough to take care of the bitchgirl if she were really foolish enough to show her face.\n","Processing asent: And she might be.\n","Processing asent: What girl of thirteen wasnt foolish?\n","Processing asent: Youre going to be all right, she said.\n","Processing asent: He sighed again.\n","Processing asent: Hope so.\n","Processing asent: If not, its been a damn good run.\n","Processing asent: None of that talk.\n","Processing asent: Everyone who sticks is going to be all right.\n","Processing asent: Its my promise, and I keep my promises.\n","Processing asent: Now lets see what our little friend from New Hampshire has to say for herself.\n","Processing asent: Less than a minute after Rose settled into a chair next to the big plastic bingo drum (with her cooling mug of coffee beside it), the Lodges pay telephone exploded with a twentieth-century clatter that made her jump.\n","Processing asent: She let it ring twice before lifting the receiver from the cradle and speaking in her most modulated voice.\n","Processing asent: Hello, dear.\n","Processing asent: You could have reached out to my mind, you know.\n","Processing asent: It would have saved you long-distance charges.\n","Processing asent: A thing the bitchgirl would have been very unwise to try.\n","Processing asent: Abra Stone wasnt the only one who could lay traps.\n","Processing asent: Im coming for you, the girl said.\n","Processing asent: The voice was so young, so fresh!\n","Processing asent: Rose thought of all the useful steam that would come with that freshness and felt greed rise in her like an unslaked thirst.\n","Processing asent: So youve said.\n","Processing asent: Are you sure you really want to do that, dear?\n","Processing asent: Will you be there if I do?\n","Processing asent: Or only your trained rats?\n","Processing asent: Rose felt a trill of anger.\n","Processing asent: Not helpful, but of course she had never been much of a morning person.\n","Processing asent: Why would I not be, dear?\n","Processing asent: She kept her voice calm and slightly indulgentthe voice of a mother (or so she imagined; she had never been one) speaking to a tantrum-prone toddler.\n","Processing asent: Because youre a coward.\n","Processing asent: Im curious to know what you base that assumption on, Rose said.\n","Processing asent: Her tone was the sameindulgent, slightly amusedbut her hand had tightened on the phone, and pressed it harder against her ear.\n","Processing asent: Never having met me.\n","Processing asent: Sure I have.\n","Processing asent: Inside my head, and I sent you running with your tail between your legs.\n","Processing asent: And you kill kids.\n","Processing asent: Only cowards kill kids.\n","Processing asent: You dont need to justify yourself to a child, she told herself.\n","Processing asent: Especially not a rube.\n","Processing asent: But she heard herself saying, You know nothing about us.\n","Processing asent: What we are, or what we have to do in order to survive.\n","Processing asent: A tribe of cowards is what you are, the bitchgirl said.\n","Processing asent: You think youre so talented and so strong, but the only thing youre really good at is eating and living long lives.\n","Processing asent: Youre like hyenas.\n","Processing asent: You kill the weak and then run away.\n","Processing asent: Cowards.\n","Processing asent: The contempt in her voice was like acid in Roses ear.\n","Processing asent: Thats not true!\n","Processing asent: And youre the chief coward.\n","Processing asent: You wouldnt come after me, would you?\n","Processing asent: No, not you.\n","Processing asent: You sent those others instead.\n","Processing asent: Are we going to have a reasonable conversation, or\n","Processing asent: Whats reasonable about killing kids so you can steal the stuff in their minds?\n","Processing asent: Whats reasonable about that, you cowardly old whore?\n","Processing asent: You sent your friends to do your work, you hid behind them, and I guess that was smart, because now theyre all dead.\n","Processing asent: You stupid little bitch, you dont know anything!\n","Processing asent: Rose leaped to her feet.\n","Processing asent: Her thighs bumped the table and her coffee spilled, running beneath the bingo drum.\n","Processing asent: Long Paul peeked through the kitchen doorway, took one look at her face, and pulled back.\n","Processing asent: Whos the coward?\n","Processing asent: Whos the real coward?\n","Processing asent: You can say such things over the phone, but you could never say them looking into my face!\n","Processing asent: How many will you have to have with you when I come?\n","Processing asent: Abra taunted.\n","Processing asent: How many, you yellow bitch?\n","Processing asent: Rose said nothing.\n","Processing asent: She had to get herself under control, she knew it, but to be talked to this

alone?\n","Processing asent: the bitchgirl asked.\n","Processing asent: Try me, Rose spat.\n","Processing asent: There was a pause on the other end, and when the bitchgirl next spoke, she sounded thoughtful.\n","Processing asent: One-on-one?\n","Processing asent: No, you wouldnt dare.\n","Processing asent: A coward like you would never dare.\n","Processing asent: Not even against a

it was nothing to him whether they spent the night or not.\n","Processing asent: Billy went into Crownville proper to pick up a couple of pizzas.\n","Processing asent: Then they settled in, Dan and Abra talking turn and turn about, filling in the others on everything that had happened and everything that was going to happen.\n","Processing asent: If things went as they hoped, that was.\n","Processing asent: No, Lucy said at once.\n","Processing asent: Its far too dangerous.\n","Processing asent: For both of you.\n","Processing asent: John offered a bleak grin.\n","Processing asent: The most dangerous thing would be to ignore these . . . these things.\n","Processing asent: Rose says that if Abra doesnt come to her, shell come to Abra.\n","Processing asent: Shes, like, fixated on her, Billy said, and selected a slice of pepperoni-and-mushroom.\n","Processing asent: Happens lots of times with crazy people.\n","Processing asent: All you have to do to know that is watch Dr. Phil.\n","Processing asent: Lucy fixed her daughter with a reproachful glance.\n","Processing asent: You goaded her.\n","Processing asent: That was a dangerous thing to do, but when she has a chance to settle down\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Although no one interrupted, she trailed off.\n","Processing asent: Maybe, Dan thought, she heard how implausible that sounded when it was actually articulated.\n","Processing asent: They wont stop, Mom, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: She wont stop.\n","Processing asent: Abra will be safe enough, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Theres a wheel.\n","Processing asent: I dont know how to explain it any better than that.\n","Processing asent: If things get badif they go wrongAbra will use the wheel to get away.\n","Processing asent: To pull out.\n","Processing asent: Shes promised me that.\n","Processing asent: Thats right, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: I promised.\n","Processing asent: Dan fixed her with a hard look.\n","Processing asent: And youll keep it, wont you?\n","Processing asent: Yes, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: She spoke firmly enough, although with obvious reluctance.\n","Processing asent: I will.\n","Processing asent: Theres all those kids to consider, too, John said.\n","Processing asent: Well never know how many this True Knot has taken over the years.\n","Processing asent: Hundreds, maybe.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought that if they lived as long as Abra believed, the number was probably in the thousands.\n","Processing asent: He said, Or how many they will take, even if they leave Abra alone.\n","Processing asent: Thats assuming the measles doesnt kill them all, Dave said hopefully.\n","Processing asent: He turned to John.\n","Processing asent: You said that really might happen.\n","Processing asent: They want me because they think I can cure the measles, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Duh.\n","Processing asent: Keep a civil tongue, miss, Lucy said, but she spoke absently.\n","Processing asent: She picked up the last slice of pizza, looked at it, then threw it back in the box.\n","Processing asent: I dont care about the other kids.\n","Processing asent: I care about Abra.\n","Processing asent: I know how horrible that sounds, but its the truth.\n","Processing asent: You wouldnt feel that way if youd seen all those little pictures in the Shopper, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: I cant get them out of my head.\n","Processing asent: I dream about them sometimes.\n","Processing asent: If this crazy woman has half a brain, shell know Abra isnt coming alone, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: Whats she going to do, fly to Denver and then rent a car?\n","Processing asent: A thirteen-year-old?\n","Processing asent: And, with a half-humorous look at his daughter: Duh.\n","Processing asent: Dan said, Rose already knows from what happened at Cloud Gap that Abras got friends.\n","Processing asent: What she doesnt know is that she has at least one with the shining.\n","Processing asent: He looked at Abra for confirmation.\n","Processing asent: She nodded.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Lucy.\n","Processing asent: Dave.\n","Processing asent: Together, I think that Abra and I can put an end to thishe searched for the right word and found only one that fitplague.\n","Processing asent: Either of us alone . . .

gave her the Death Stare, the one mothers save especially for rebellious young daughters.\n","Processing asent: It had always worked with Abra, even when she was in one of her furies, but it didnt this time.\n","Processing asent: She looked back at her mother calmly.\n","Processing asent: And with a sadness that made Lucys heart feel cold.\n","Processing asent: Dave took Lucys hand.\n","Processing asent: I think this has to be done.\n","Processing asent: There was silence in the room.\n","Processing asent: Abra was the one who broke it.\n","Processing asent: If nobodys going to eat that last slice, I am.\n","Processing asent: Im starving.\n","Processing asent: They went over it several more times, and at a couple of points voices were raised, but essentially, everything had been said.\n","Processing asent: Except, it turned out, for one thing.\n","Processing asent: When they left the room, Billy refused to get into Johns Suburban.\n","Processing asent: Im goin, he told Dan.\n","Processing asent: Billy, I appreciate the thought, but its not a good idea.\n","Processing asent: My truck, my rules.\n","Processing asent: Besides, are you really gonna make the Colorado high country by Monday afternoon on your own?\n","Processing asent: Dont make me laugh.\n","Processing asent: You look like shit on a stick.\n","Processing asent: Dan said, Several people have told me that lately, but none have put it so elegantly.\n","Processing asent: Billy didnt smile.\n","Processing asent: I can help you.\n","Processing asent: Im old, but I aint dead.\n","Processing asent: Take him, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Hes right.\n","Processing asent: Dan looked at her closely.\n","Processing asent: (do you know something Abra)\n","Processing asent: The reply was quick.\n","Processing asent: (no feel something)\n","Processing asent: That was good enough for Dan.\n","Processing asent: He held out his arms and Abra hugged him hard, the side of her face pressed against his chest.\n","Processing asent: Dan could have held her like that for a long time, but he let her go and stepped back.\n","Processing asent: (let me know when you get close Uncle Dan Ill come)\n","Processing asent: (just little touches remember)\n","Processing asent: She sent an image instead of a thought in words: a smoke detector beeping the way they did when they wanted a battery change.\n","Processing asent: She remembered perfectly.\n","Processing asent: As she went to the car, Abra said to her father, We need to stop on the way back for a get-well card.\n","Processing asent: Julie Cross broke her wrist yesterday in soccer practice.\n","Processing asent: He frowned at her.\n","Processing asent: How do you know that?\n","Processing asent: I know, she said.\n","Processing asent: He gently pulled one of her pigtails.\n","Processing asent: You really could do it all along, couldnt you?\n","Processing asent: I dont understand why you didnt just tell us, Abba-Doo.\n","Processing asent: Dan, who had grown up with the shining, could have answered that question.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes parents needed to be protected.\n","Processing asent: So they parted.\n","Processing asent: Johns SUV went east and Billys pickup truck went west, with Billy behind the wheel.\n","Processing asent: Dan said, Are you really okay to drive, Billy?\n","Processing asent: After all the sleep I got last night?\n","Processing asent: Sweetheart, I could drive to California.\n","Processing asent: Do you know where were going?\n","Processing asent: I bought a road atlas in town while I was waitin for the pizza.\n","Processing asent: So youd made up your mind even then.\n","Processing asent: And you knew what Abra and I were planning.\n","Processing asent: Well . . . sorta.\n","Processing asent: When you need me to take over, just yell, Dan said, and promptly fell asleep with his head against the passenger window.\n","Processing asent: He descended through a deepening depth of unpleasant images.\n","Processing asent: First the hedge animals at the Overlook, the ones that moved when you werent looking.\n","Processing asent: This was followed by Mrs. Massey from Room 217, who now wore a cocked tophat.\n","Processing asent: Still descending, he revisited the battle at Cloud Gap.\n","Processing asent: Only this time when he burst into the Winnebago, he found Abra lying on the floor with her throat cut and Rose standing over her with a dripping straight razor.\n","Processing asent: Rose saw Dan and the bottom half of her face dropped away in an obscene grin where one long tooth gleamed.\n","Processing asent: I told her it would end this way but she wouldnt listen, she said.\n","Processing asent: Children so rarely do.\n","Processing asent: Below this there was only darkness.\n","Processing asent: When he woke it was to twilight with a broken white line running down the middle of it.\n","Processing asent: They were on an interstate highway.\n","Processing asent: How long did I sleep?\n","Processing asent: Billy glanced at his watch.\n","Processing asent: A good long while.\n","Processing asent: Feel better?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: He did and didnt.\n","Processing asent: His head was clear, but his stomach hurt like hell.\n","Processing asent: Considering what he had seen that morning in the mirror, he wasnt surprised.\n","Processing asent: Where are we?\n","Processing asent: Hunnert-n-fifty miles east of Cincinnati, give or take.\n","Processing asent: You slept through two gas stops.\n","Processing asent: And you snore.\n","Processing asent: Dan sat up straight.\n","Processing asent: Were in Ohio?\n","Processing asent: Christ!\n","Processing asent: What time is it?\n","Processing asent: Billy glanced at his watch.\n","Processing asent: Quarter past six.\n","Processing asent: Wasnt no big thing; light traffic and no rain.\n","Processing asent: I think we got an angel ridin with us.\n","Processing asent: Well, lets find a motel.\n","Processing asent: You need to sleep and I have to piss like a racehorse.\n","Processing asent: Not surprised.\n","Processing asent: Billy pulled off at the next exit showing signs for gas, food, and motels.\n","Processing asent: He pulled into a Wendys and got a bag of burgers while Dan used the mens.\n","Processing asent: When they got back into the truck, Dan took one bite of his double, put it back in the bag, and sipped cautiously at a coffee milkshake.\n","Processing asent: That his stomach seemed willing to take.\n","Processing asent: Billy looked shocked.\n","Processing asent: Man, you gotta eat!\n","Processing asent: Whats wrong with you?\n","Processing asent: I guess pizza for breakfast was a bad idea.\n","Processing asent: And because Billy was still looking at him: The shakes fine.\n","Processing asent: All I need.\n","Processing asent: Eyes on the road, Billy.\n","Processing asent: We cant help Abra if were getting patched up in some emergency room.\n","Processing asent: Five minutes later, Billy pulled the truck under the canopy of a Fairfield Inn with a blinking ROOMS AVAILABLE sign over the door.\n","Processing asent: He turned off the engine but didnt get out.\n","Processing asent: Since Im riskin my life with you, chief, I want to know what ails you.\n","Processing asent: Dan almost pointed out that taking the risk had been Billys idea, not his, but that wasnt fair.\n","Processing asent: He explained.\n","Processing asent: Billy listened in round-eyed silence.\n","Processing asent: Jesus jumped-up Christ, he said when Dan had finished.\n","Processing asent: Unless I missed it, Dan said, theres nothing in the New Testament about Jesus jumping.\n","Processing asent: Although I guess He mightve, as a child.\n","Processing asent: Most of them do.\n","Processing asent: You want to check us in, or should I do it?\n","Processing asent: Billy continued to sit where he was.\n","Processing asent: Does Abra know?\n","Processing asent: Dan shook his head.\n","Processing asent: But she could find out.\n","Processing asent: Could but wont.\n","Processing asent: She knows its wrong to peek, especially when its someone you care about.\n","Processing asent: Shed no more do it than shed spy on her parents when they were making love.\n","Processing asent: You know that from when you were a kid?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes you see a littleyou cant help itbut then you turn away.\n","Processing asent: Are you gonna be all right, Danny?\n","Processing asent: For awhile.\n","Processing asent: He thought of the sluggish flies on his lips and cheeks and forehead.\n","Processing asent: Long enough.\n","Processing asent: What about after?\n","Processing asent: Ill worry about after after.\n","Processing asent: One day at a time.\n","Processing asent: Lets check in.\n","Processing asent: We need to get an early start.\n","Processing asent: Have you heard from Abra?\n","Processing asent: Dan smiled.\n","Processing asent: Shes fine.\n","Processing asent: At least so far.\n","Processing asent: But she wasnt, not really.\n","Processing asent: She sat at her desk with a half-read copy of The Fixer in her hand, trying not to look at her bedroom window, lest she should see a certain someone looking in at her.\n","Processing asent: She knew something was wrong with Dan, and she knew he didnt want her to know what it was, but had been tempted to look anyway, in spite of all the years shed taught herself to steer clear of APB: adult private business.\n","Processing asent: Two things held her back.\n","Processing asent: One was the knowledge that, like it or not, she couldnt help him with it now.\n","Processing asent: The other (this was stronger) was knowing he might sense her in his head.\n","Processing asent: If so, he would be disappointed in her.\n","Processing asent: Its probably locked up, anyway, she thought.\n","Processing asent: He can do that.\n","Processing asent: Hes pretty strong.\n","Processing asent: Not as strong as she was, though . . . or, if you put it in terms of the shining, as bright.\n","Processing asent: She could open his mental lockboxes and peer at the things inside, but she thought doing so might be dangerous for both of them.\n","Processing asent: There was no concrete reason for this, it was just a feelinglike the one shed had about how it would be a good idea for Mr. Freeman to go with Danbut she trusted it.\n","Processing asent: Besides, maybe it was something that could help them.\n","Processing asent: She could hope for that.\n","Processing asent: True hope is swift, and flies on swallows wingsthat was another line from Shakespeare.\n","Processing asent: Dont you look at that window, either.\n","Processing asent: Dont you dare.\n","Processing asent: Absolutely not.\n","Processing asent: Never.\n","Processing asent: So she did, and there was Rose, grinning in at her from below her rakishly tilted hat.\n","Processing asent: All billowing hair and pale porcelain skin and dark mad eyes and rich red lips masking that one snaggle tooth.\n","Processing asent: That tusk.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to die screaming, bitchgirl.\n","Processing asent: Abra closed her eyes and thought hard\n","Processing asent: (not there not there not there)\n","Processing asent: and opened them again.\n","Processing asent: The grinning face at the window was gone.\n","Processing asent: But not really.\n","Processing asent: Somewhere high in the mountainsat the roof of the worldRose was thinking about her.\n","Processing asent: And waiting.\n","Processing asent: The motel had a breakfast buffet.\n","Processing asent: Because his traveling companion was watching him, Dan made a point of eating some cereal and yogurt.\n","Processing asent: Billy looked relieved.\n","Processing asent: While he checked them out, Dan strolled to the lobby mens room.\n","Processing asent: Once inside, he turned the lock, fell to his knees, and vomited up everything hed eaten.\n","Processing asent: The undigested cereal and yogurt floated in a red foam.\n","Processing asent: All right?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked when Dan rejoined him at the desk.\n","Processing asent: Fine, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Lets roll.\n","Processing asent: According to Billys road atlas, it was about twelve hundred miles from Cincinnati to Denver.\n","Processing asent: Sidewinder lay roughly seventy-five miles further west, along roads full of switchbacks and lined with steep drops.\n","Processing asent: Dan tried driving for awhile on that Sunday afternoon, but tired quickly and turned the wheel over to Billy again.\n","Processing asent: He fell asleep, and when he woke up, the sun was going down.\n","Processing asent: They were in Iowahome of the late Brad Trevor.\n","Processing asent: He had been afraid distance would make mental communication difficult or even impossible, but she came back promptly, and as strong as ever; if shed been a radio station, she would have been broadcasting at 100,000 watts.\n","Processing asent: She was in her room, pecking away on her computer at some homework assignment or other.\n","Processing asent: He was both amused and saddened to realize she had Hoppy, her stuffed rabbit, on her lap.\n","Processing asent: The strain of what they were doing had regressed her to a younger Abra, at least on the emotional side.\n","Processing asent: With the line between them wide open, she caught this.\n","Processing asent: (dont worry about me Im all right)\n","Processing asent: (good because you have a call to make)\n","Processing asent: (yes okay are you all right)\n","Processing asent: She knew better but didnt ask, and that was just the way he wanted it.\n","Processing asent: (have you got the)\n","Processing asent: She made a picture.\n","Processing asent: (not yet its Sunday stores not open)\n","Processing asent: Another picture, one that made him smile.\n","Processing asent: A Walmart . . . except the sign out front read ABRAS SUPERSTORE.\n","Processing asent: (they wouldnt sell us what we need well find one that will)\n","Processing asent: (okay I guess)\n","Processing asent: (you know what to say to her?)\n","Processing asent: (shell try to suck you into a long conversation try to snoop dont let her)\n","Processing asent: (let me hear from you after so I wont worry)\n","Processing asent: Of course he would worry plenty.\n","Processing asent: (I will I love you Uncle Dan)\n","Processing asent: (love you too)\n","Processing asent: He made a kiss.\n","Processing asent: Abra made one back: big red cartoon lips.\n","Processing asent: He could almost feel them on his cheek.\n","Processing asent: Then she was gone.\n","Processing asent: Billy was staring at him.\n","Processing asent: You were just talkin to her, werent you?\n","Processing asent: Indeed I was.\n","Processing asent: Eyes on the road, Billy.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, yeah.\n","Processing asent: You sound like my ex-wife.\n","Processing asent: Billy put on his blinker, switched to the passing lane, and rolled past a huge and lumbering Fleetwood Pace Arrow motorhome.\n","Processing asent: Dan stared at it, wondering who was inside and if they were looking out the tinted windows.\n","Processing asent: I want to make another hundred or so miles before we quit for the night, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Way I got tomorrow figured, that should give us an hour to do your errand and still put us in the high country about the time you and Abra set for the showdown.\n","Processing asent: But well want to get on the road before daybreak.\n","Processing asent: Fine.\n","Processing asent: You understand how this will go?\n","Processing asent: I get how its supposed to go.\n","Processing asent: Billy glanced at him.\n","Processing asent: You better hope that if they have binoculars, they dont use them.\n","Processing asent: Do you think we might come back alive?\n","Processing asent: Tell me the truth.\n","Processing asent: If the answers no, Im gonna order me the biggest steak dinner you ever saw when we stop for the night.\n","Processing asent: MasterCard can chase my relatives for the last credit card bill, and guess what?\n","Processing asent: I aint got any relatives.\n","Processing asent: Unless you count the ex, and if I was on fire she wouldnt piss on me to put me out.\n","Processing asent: Well come back, Dan said, but it sounded pale.\n","Processing asent: He felt too sick to put up much of a front.\n","Processing asent: Yeah?\n","Processing asent: Well, maybe Ill have that steak dinner, anyway.\n","Processing asent: What about you?\n","Processing asent: I think I could manage a little soup.\n","Processing asent: As long as its clear.\n","Processing asent: The thought of eating anything too thick to read a newspaper throughtomato bisque, cream of mushroommade his stomach cringe.\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: Why dont you close your eyes again?\n","Processing asent: Dan knew he couldnt sleep deeply, no matter how tired and sick he feltnot while Abra was dealing with the ancient horror that looked like a womanbut he managed a doze.\n","Processing asent: It was thin but rich enough to grow more dreams, first of the Overlook (todays version featured the elevator that ran by itself in the middle of the night), then of his niece.\n","Processing asent: This time Abra had been strangled with a length of electrical cord.\n","Processing asent: She stared at Dan with bulging, accusing eyes.\n","Processing asent: It was all too easy to read what was in them.\n","Processing asent: You said youd help me.\n","Processing asent: You said youd save me.\n","Processing asent: Where were you?\n","Processing asent: Abra kept putting off the thing she had to do until she realized her mother would soon be pestering her to go to bed.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt going to school in the morning, but it was still going to be a big day.\n","Processing asent: And, perhaps, a very long night.\n","Processing asent: Putting things off only makes them worse, cara mia.\n","Processing asent: That was the gospel according to Momo.\n","Processing asent: Abra looked toward her window, wishing she could see her great-grandma there instead of Rose.\n","Processing asent: That would be good.\n","Processing asent: Momes, Im so scared, she said.\n","Processing asent: But after two long and steadying breaths, she picked up her iPhone and dialed the Overlook Lodge at Bluebell Campground.\n","Processing asent: A man answered, and when Abra said she wanted to talk to Rose, he asked who she was.\n","Processing asent: You know who I am, she said.\n","Processing asent: Andwith what she hoped was irritating inquisitiveness: Are you sick yet, mister?\n","Processing asent: The man on the other end (it was Toady Slim) didnt answer that, but she heard him murmur to someone.\n","Processing asent: A moment later, Rose was on, her composure once more firmly in place.\n","Processing asent: Hello, dear.\n","Processing asent: Where are you?\n","Processing asent: On my way, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Are you really?\n","Processing asent: Thats nice, dear.\n","Processing asent: So I dont suppose that Id find this call came from a New Hampshire area code if I star-sixty-nined it?\n","Processing asent: Of course you would, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Im using my cell.\n","Processing asent: You need to get with the twenty-first century, bitch.\n","Processing asent: What do you want?\n","Processing asent: The voice on the other end was now curt.\n","Processing asent: To make sure you know the rules, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Ill be there at five tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: Ill be in an old red truck.\n","Processing asent: Driven by whom?\n","Processing asent: My uncle Billy, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: Was he one of the ones from the ambush?\n","Processing asent: Hes the one who was with me and the Crow.\n","Processing asent: Stop asking questions.\n","Processing asent: Just shut up and listen.\n","Processing asent: So rude, Rose said sadly.\n","Processing asent: Hell park way at the end of the lot, by the sign that says KIDS EAT FREE WHEN COLORADO PRO TEAMS WIN.\n","Processing asent: I see youve been on our website.\n","Processing asent: Thats sweet.\n","Processing asent: Or was it your uncle, perhaps?\n","Processing asent: Hes very brave to act as your chauffeur.\n","Processing asent: Is he your fathers brother or your mothers?\n","Processing asent: Rube families are a hobby of mine.\n","Processing asent: I make family trees.\n","Processing asent: Shell try to snoop, Dan had told her, and how right he was.\n","Processing asent: What part of shut up and listen dont you understand?\n","Processing asent: Do you want this to happen or not?\n","Processing asent: No reply, just waiting silence.\n","Processing asent: Creepy waiting silence.\n","Processing asent: From the parking lot, well be able to see everything: the campground, the Lodge, and Roof O the World on top of the hill.\n","Processing asent: My uncle and me better see you up there, and we better not see the people from your True Knot anywhere.\n","Processing asent: Theyre going to stay in that meeting-hall thingy while we do our business.\n","Processing asent: In the big room, got it?\n","Processing asent: Uncle Billy wont know if theyre not where theyre supposed to be, but I will.\n","Processing asent: If I pick up a single one somewhere else, well be gone.\n","Processing asent: Your uncle will stay in his truck?\n","Processing asent: Ill stay in the truck, until were sure.\n","Processing asent: Then hell get back in and Ill come to you.\n","Processing asent: I dont want him anywhere near you.\n","Processing asent: All right, dear.\n","Processing asent: It will be as you say.\n","Processing asent: No, it wont.\n","Processing asent: Youre lying.\n","Processing asent: But so was Abra, which kind of made them even.\n","Processing asent: I have one really important question, dear, Rose said pleasantly.\n","Processing asent: Abra almost asked what it was, then remembered her uncles advice.\n","Processing asent: Her real uncle.\n","Processing asent: One question, right.\n","Processing asent: Which would lead to another . . . and another . . . and another.\n","Processing asent: Choke on it, she said, and hung up.\n","Processing asent: Her hands began to tremble.\n","Processing asent: Then her legs and arms and shoulders.\n","Processing asent: Abra?\n","Processing asent: Mom.\n","Processing asent: Calling from the foot of the stairs.\n","Processing asent: She feels it.\n","Processing asent: Just a little, but she does feel it.\n","Processing asent: Is that a mom thing or a shining thing?\n","Processing asent: Honey, are you okay?\n","Processing asent: Fine, Mom!\n","Processing asent: Getting ready for bed!\n","Processing asent: Ten minutes, then were coming up for kisses.\n","Processing asent: Be in your PJs.\n","Processing asent: If they knew who I was just talking to, Abra thought.\n","Processing asent: But they didnt.\n","Processing asent: They only thought they knew what was going on.\n","Processing asent: She was here in her bedroom, every door and window in the house was locked, and they believed that made her safe.\n","Processing asent: Even her father, who had seen the True Knot in action.\n","Processing asent: But Dan knew.\n","Processing asent: She closed her eyes and reached out to him.\n","Processing asent: Dan and Billy were under another motel canopy.\n","Processing asent: And still nothing from Abra.\n","Processing asent: That was bad.\n","Processing asent: Come on, chief, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Lets get you inside and\n","Processing asent: Then she was there.\n","Processing asent: Thank God.\n","Processing asent: Hush a minute, Dan said, and listened.\n","Processing asent: Two minutes later he turned to Billy, who thought the smile on his face finally made him look like Dan Torrance again.\n","Processing asent: Was it her?\n","Processing asent: Howd it go?\n","Processing asent: Abra says it went fine.\n","Processing asent: Were in business.\n","Processing asent: No questions about me?\n","Processing asent: Just which side of the family you were on.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Billy, the uncle thing was a bit of a mistake.\n","Processing asent: Youre way too old to be Lucys or Davids brother.\n","Processing asent: When we stop tomorrow to do our errand, you need to buy sunglasses.\n","Processing asent: Big ones.\n","Processing asent: And keep that ball cap of yours jammed down all the way to your ears, so your hair doesnt show.\n","Processing asent: Maybe I should get some Just For Men, while Im at it.\n","Processing asent: Dont sass me, you old fart.\n","Processing asent: That made Billy grin.\n","Processing asent: Lets get registered and get some food.\n","Processing asent: You look better.\n","Processing asent: Like you could actually eat.\n","Processing asent: Soup, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: No sense pressing my luck.\n","Processing asent: Soup.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: He ate it all.\n","Processing asent: Slowly.\n","Processing asent: Andreminding himself that this would be over one way or the other in less than twenty-four hourshe managed to keep it down.\n","Processing asent: They dined in Billys room and when he was finally finished, Dan stretched out on the carpet.\n","Processing asent: It eased the pain in his gut a little.\n","Processing asent: Whats that?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked.\n","Processing asent: Some kind of yogi shit?\n","Processing asent: Exactly.\n","Processing asent: I learned it watching Yogi Bear cartoons.\n","Processing asent: Run it down for me again.\n","Processing asent: I got it, chief, dont worry.\n","Processing asent: Now youre starting to sound like Casey Kingsley.\n","Processing asent: A scary thought.\n","Processing asent: Now run it down again.\n","Processing asent: Abra starts pinging around Denver.\n","Processing asent: If they have someone who can listen, theyll know shes coming.\n","Processing asent: And that shes in the neighborhood.\n","Processing asent: We get to Sidewinder earlysay four instead of fiveand drive right past the road to the campground.\n","Processing asent: They wont see the truck.\n","Processing asent: Unless they post a sentry down by the highway, that is.\n","Processing asent: I dont think they will.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought of another AA aphorism: Were powerless over people, places, and things.\n","Processing asent: Like most alkie nuggets, it was seventy percent true and thirty percent rah-rah bullshit.\n","Processing asent: In any case, we cant control everything.\n","Processing asent: Carry on.\n","Processing asent: Theres a picnic area about a mile further up the road.\n","Processing asent: You went there a couple of times with your mom, before you guys got snowed in for the winter.\n","Processing asent: Billy paused.\n","Processing asent: Just her and you?\n","Processing asent: Never your dad?\n","Processing asent: He was writing.\n","Processing asent: Working on a play.\n","Processing asent: Go on.\n","Processing asent: Billy did.\n","Processing asent: Dan listened closely, then nodded.\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: Youve got it.\n","Processing asent: Didnt I say?\n","Processing asent: Now can I ask a question?\n","Processing asent: By tomorrow afternoon, will you still be able to walk a mile?\n","Processing asent: Ill be able to.\n","Processing asent: I better be.\n","Processing asent: Thanks to an early start4 a.m., long before first lightDan Torrance and Billy Freeman began to see a horizon-spanning cloud shortly after 9 a.m.\n","Processing asent: An hour later, by which time the blue-gray cloud had resolved itself into a mountain range, they stopped in the town of Martenville, Colorado.\n","Processing asent: There, on the short (and mostly deserted) main street, Dan saw not what he was hoping for, but something even better: a childrens clothing store called Kids Stuff.\n","Processing asent: Half a block down was a drugstore flanked by a dusty-looking hockshop and a Video Express with CLOSING MUST SELL ALL STOCK AT BARGAIN PRICES soaped in the window.\n","Processing asent: He sent Billy to Martenville Drugs & Sundries to get sunglasses and stepped through the door of Kids Stuff.\n","Processing asent: The place had an unhappy, losing-hope vibe.\n","Processing asent: He was the only customer.\n","Processing asent: Here was somebodys good idea going bad, probably thanks to the big-box mall stores in Sterling or Fort Morgan.\n","Processing asent: Why buy local when you could drive a little and get cheaper pants and dresses for back-to-school?\n","Processing asent: So what if they were made in Mexico or Costa Rica?\n","Processing asent: A tired-looking woman with a tired-looking hairdo came out from behind the counter and gave Dan a tired-looking smile.\n","Processing asent: She asked if she could help him.\n","Processing asent: Dan said she could.\n","Processing asent: When he told her what he wanted, her eyes went round.\n","Processing asent: I know its unusual, Dan said, but get with me on this a little.\n","Processing asent: Ill pay cash.\n","Processing asent: He got what he wanted.\n","Processing asent: In little losing-hope stores off the turnpike, the C-word went a long way.\n","Processing asent: As they neared Denver, Dan got in touch with Abra.\n","Processing asent: He closed his eyes and visualized the wheel they both now knew about.\n","Processing asent: In the town of Anniston, Abra did the same.\n","Processing asent: It was easier this time.\n","Processing asent: When he opened his eyes again, he was looking down the slope of the Stones back lawn at the Saco River, gleaming in the afternoon sun.\n","Processing asent: Abra opened hers on a view of the Rockies.\n","Processing asent: Wow, Uncle Billy, theyre beautiful, arent they?\n","Processing asent: Billy glanced at the man sitting beside him.\n","Processing asent: Dan had crossed his legs in a way that was utterly unlike him, and was bouncing one foot.\n","Processing asent: Color had come back into his cheeks, and there was a bright clarity in his eyes that had been missing on their run west.\n","Processing asent: They sure are, honey, he said.\n","Processing asent: Dan smiled and closed his eyes.\n","Processing asent: When he opened them again, the health Abra had brought to his face was fading.\n","Processing asent: Like a rose without water, Billy thought.\n","Processing asent: Ping, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: He smiled again, but this one was weary.\n","Processing asent: Like a smoke detector that needs a battery change.\n","Processing asent: Do you think they heard it?\n","Processing asent: I sure hope so, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Rose was pacing back and forth near her EarthCruiser when Token Charlie came running up.\n","Processing asent: The True had taken steam that morning, all but one of the canisters she had in storage, and on top of what Rose had taken on her own over the last couple of days, she was too wired even to think about sitting down.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: Tell me something good.\n","Processing asent: I got her, hows that for good?\n","Processing asent: Wired himself, Charlie grabbed Rose by the arms and whirled her around, making her hair fly.\n","Processing asent: I got her!\n","Processing asent: Just for a few seconds, but it was her!\n","Processing asent: Did you see the uncle?\n","Processing asent: No, she was looking out the windshield at the mountains.\n","Processing asent: She said they were beautiful\n","Processing asent: They are, Rose said.\n","Processing asent: A grin was spreading on her lips.\n","Processing asent: Dont you agree, Charlie?\n","Processing asent: and he said they sure were.\n","Processing asent: Theyre coming, Rosie!\n","Processing asent: They really are!\n","Processing asent: Did she know you were there?\n","Processing asent: He let go of her, frowning.\n","Processing asent: I cant say for sure . . . Grampa Flick probably could\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Just tell me what you think.\n","Processing asent: Probably not.\n","Processing asent: Thats good enough for me.\n","Processing asent: Go someplace quiet.\n","Processing asent: Someplace where you can concentrate without being disturbed.\n","Processing asent: Sit and listen.\n","Processing asent: Ifwhenyou pick her up again, let me know.\n","Processing asent: I dont want to lose track of her if I can help it.\n","Processing asent: If you need more steam, ask for it.\n","Processing asent: I saved a little.\n","Processing asent: No, no, Im fine.\n","Processing asent: Ill listen.\n","Processing asent: Ill listen hard!\n","Processing asent: Token Charlie gave a rather wild laugh and rushed off.\n","Processing asent: Rose didnt think he had any idea where he was going, and she didnt care.\n","Processing asent: As long as he kept listening.\n","Processing asent: Dan and Billy were at the foot of the Flatirons by noon.\n","Processing asent: As he watched the Rockies draw closer, Dan thought of all the wandering years he had avoided them.\n","Processing asent: That in turn made him think of some poem or other, one about how you could spend years running, but in the end you always wound up facing yourself in a hotel room, with a naked bulb hanging overhead and a revolver on the table.\n","Processing asent: Because they had time, they left the freeway and drove into Boulder.\n","Processing asent: Billy was hungry.\n","Processing asent: Dan wasnt . . . but he was curious.\n","Processing asent: Billy pulled the truck into a sandwich shop parking lot, but when he asked Dan what he could get him, Dan only shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Sure?\n","Processing asent: You got a lot ahead of you.\n","Processing asent: Ill eat when this is over.\n","Processing asent: Well\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Billy went into the Subway for a Buffalo Chicken.\n","Processing asent: Dan got in touch with Abra.\n","Processing asent: The wheel turned.\n","Processing asent: When Billy came out, Dan nodded to his wrapped footlong.\n","Processing asent: Save that a couple of minutes.\n","Processing asent: As long as were in Boulder, theres something I want to check out.\n","Processing asent: Five minutes later, they were on Arapahoe Street.\n","Processing asent: Two blocks from the seedy little bar-and-caf district, he told Billy to pull over.\n","Processing asent: Go on and chow that chicken.\n","Processing asent: I wont be long.\n","Processing asent: Dan got out of the truck and stood on the cracked sidewalk, looking at a slumped three-story building with a sign in the window reading EFFICIENCY APTS GOOD STUDENT VALUE.\n","Processing asent: The lawn was balding.\n","Processing asent: Weeds grew up through the cracks in the sidewalk.\n","Processing asent: He had doubted that this place would still be here, had believed that Arapahoe would now be a street of condos populated by well-to-do slackers who drank lattes from Starbucks, checked their Facebook pages half a dozen times a day, and Twittered like mad bastards.\n","Processing asent: But here it was, and lookingso far as he could tellexactly as it had back in the day.\n","Processing asent: Billy joined him, sandwich in one hand.\n","Processing asent: Weve still got seventy-five miles ahead of us, Danno.\n","Processing asent: Best we get our asses up the pass.\n","Processing asent: Right, Dan said, then went on looking at the building with the peeling green paint.\n","Processing asent: Once a little boy had lived here; once he had sat on the very piece of curbing where Billy Freeman now stood munching his chicken footlong.\n","Processing asent: A little boy waiting for his daddy to come home from his job interview at the Overlook Hotel.\n","Processing asent: He had a balsa glider, that little boy, but the wing was busted.\n","Processing asent: It was okay, though.\n","Processing asent: When his daddy came home, he would fix it with tape and glue.\n","Processing asent: Then maybe they would fly it together.\n","Processing asent: His daddy had been a scary man, and how that little boy had loved him.\n","Processing asent: Dan said, I lived here with my mother and father before we moved up to the Overlook.\n","Processing asent: Not much, is it?\n","Processing asent: Billy shrugged.\n","Processing asent: I seen worse.\n","Processing asent: In his wandering years, Dan had, too.\n","Processing asent: Deenies apartment in Wilmington, for instance.\n","Processing asent: He pointed left.\n","Processing asent: There were a bunch of bars down that way.\n","Processing asent: One was called the Broken Drum.\n","Processing asent: Looks like urban renewal missed this side of town, so maybe its still there.\n","Processing asent: When my father and I walked past it, hed always stop and look in the window, and I could feel how thirsty he was to go inside.\n","Processing asent: So thirsty it made me thirsty.\n","Processing asent: I drank a lot of years to quench that thirst, but it never really goes away.\n","Processing asent: My dad knew that, even then.\n","Processing asent: But you loved him, I guess.\n","Processing asent: I did.\n","Processing asent: Still looking at that shambling, rundown apartment house.\n","Processing asent: Not much, but Dan couldnt help wondering how different their lives might have been if they had stayed there.\n","Processing asent: If the Overlook had not ensnared them.\n","Processing asent: He was good and bad and I loved both sides of him.\n","Processing asent: God help me, I guess I still do.\n","Processing asent: You and most kids, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: You love your folks and hope for the best.\n","Processing asent: What else can you do?\n","Processing asent: Come on, Dan.\n","Processing asent: If were gonna do this, we have to go.\n","Processing asent: Half an hour later, Boulder was behind them and they were climbing into the Rockies.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER NINETEEN\n","Processing asent: GHOSTIE PEOPLE\n","Processing asent: Although sunset was approachingin New Hampshire, at leastAbra was still on the back stoop, looking down at the river.\n","Processing asent: Hoppy was sitting nearby, on the lid of the composter.\n","Processing asent: Lucy and David came out and sat on either side of her.\n","Processing asent: John Dalton watched them from the kitchen, holding a cold cup of coffee.\n","Processing asent: His black bag was on the counter, but there was nothing in it he could use this evening.\n","Processing asent: You should come in and have some supper, Lucy said, knowing that Abra wouldntprobably couldntuntil this was over.\n","Processing asent: But you clung to the known.\n","Processing asent: Because everything looked normal, and because the danger was over a thousand miles away, that was easier for her than for her daughter.\n","Processing asent: Although Abras complexion had previously been clearas unblemished as when she was an infantshe now had nests of acne around the wings of her nose and an ugly cluster of pimples on her chin.\n","Processing asent: Just hormones kicking in, heralding the onset of true adolescence: so Lucy would have liked to believe, because that was normal.\n","Processing asent: But stress caused acne, too.\n","Processing asent: Then there was the pallor of her daughters skin and the dark circles beneath her eyes.\n","Processing asent: She looked almost as ill as Dan did when Lucy had last seen him, climbing with painful slowness into Mr. Freemans pickup truck.\n","Processing asent: Cant eat now, Mom.\n","Processing asent: No time.\n","Processing asent: I probably couldnt keep it down, anyway.\n","Processing asent: How soon before this happens, Abby?\n","Processing asent: David asked.\n","Processing asent: She looked at neither of them.\n","Processing asent: She looked fixedly down at the river, but Lucy knew she wasnt really looking at that, either.\n","Processing asent: She was far away, in a place where none of them could help her.\n","Processing asent: Not long.\n","Processing asent: You should each give me a kiss and then go inside.\n","Processing asent: But Lucy began, then saw David shake his head at her.\n","Processing asent: Only once, but very firmly.\n","Processing asent: She sighed, took one of Abras hands (how cold it was), and planted a kiss on her left cheek.\n","Processing asent: David put one on her right.\n","Processing asent: Lucy: Remember what Dan said.\n","Processing asent: If things go wrong\n","Processing asent: You should go in now, guys.\n","Processing asent: When it starts, Im going to take Hoppy and put him in my lap.\n","Processing asent: When you see that, you cant interrupt me.\n","Processing asent: Not for anything.\n","Processing asent: You could get Uncle Dan killed, and maybe Billy, too.\n","Processing asent: I might fall over, like in a faint, but it wont be a faint, so dont move me and dont let Dr. John move me, either.\n","Processing asent: Just let me be until its over.\n","Processing asent: I think Dan knows a place where we can be together.\n","Processing asent: David said, I dont understand how this can possibly work.\n","Processing asent: That woman, Rose, will see theres no little girl\n","Processing asent: You need to go in now, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: They did as she said.\n","Processing asent: Lucy looked pleadingly at John; he could only shrug and shake his head.\n","Processing asent: The three of them stood at the kitchen window, arms around one another, looking out at the little girl sitting on the stoop with her arms clasped around her knees.\n","Processing asent: There was no danger to be seen; all was placid.\n","Processing asent: But when Lucy saw Abraher little girlreach for Hoppy and take the old stuffed rabbit on her lap, she groaned.\n","Processing asent: John squeezed her shoulder.\n","Processing asent: David tightened the arm around her waist, and she gripped his hand with panicky tightness.\n","Processing asent: Please let my daughter be all right.\n","Processing asent: If something has to happen . . . something bad . . . let it happen to the half brother I never knew.\n","Processing asent: Not to her.\n","Processing asent: Itll be okay, Dave said.\n","Processing asent: She nodded.\n","Processing asent: Of course it will.\n","Processing asent: Of course it will.\n","Processing asent: They watched the girl on the stoop.\n","Processing asent: Lucy understood that if she did call to Abra, she wouldnt answer.\n","Processing asent: Abra was gone.\n","Processing asent: Billy and Dan reached the turnoff to the Trues Colorado base of operations at twenty to four, Mountain Time, which put them comfortably ahead of schedule.\n","Processing asent: There was a wooden ranch-style arch over the paved road with WELCOME TO THE BLUEBELL CAMPGROUND!\n","Processing asent: STAY AWHILE, PARTNER! carved into it.\n","Processing asent: The sign beside the road was a lot less welcoming: CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.\n","Processing asent: Billy drove past without slowing, but his eyes were busy.\n","Processing asent: Dont see nobody.\n","Processing asent: Not even on the lawns, although I suppose they coulda stashed someone in that welcome-hut doohickey.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, Danny, you look just awful.\n","Processing asent: Lucky for me the Mr. America competition isnt until later this year, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: One mile up, maybe a little less.\n","Processing asent: The sign says Scenic Turnout and Picnic Area.\n","Processing asent: What if they posted someone there?\n","Processing asent: They havent.\n","Processing asent: How can you be sure?\n","Processing asent: Because neither Abra nor her uncle Billy could possibly know about it, never having been here.\n","Processing asent: And the True doesnt know about me.\n","Processing asent: You better hope they dont.\n","Processing asent: Abra says everyones where theyre supposed to be.\n","Processing asent: Shes been checking.\n","Processing asent: Now be quiet a minute, Billy.\n","Processing asent: I need to think.\n","Processing asent: It was Hallorann he wanted to think about.\n","Processing asent: For several years following their haunted winter at the Overlook, Danny Torrance and Dick Hallorann had talked a lot.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes face-to-face, more often mind-to-mind.\n","Processing asent: Danny loved his mother, but there were things she didntcouldntunderstand.\n","Processing asent: About the lockboxes, for instance.\n","Processing asent: The ones where you put the dangerous things that the shining sometimes attracted.\n","Processing asent: Not that the lockbox thing always worked.\n","Processing asent: On several occasions he had tried to make one for the drinking, but that effort had been an abject failure (perhaps because he had wanted it to be a failure).\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Massey, though . . . and Horace Derwent\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: There was a third lockbox in storage now, but it wasnt as good as the ones hed made as a kid.\n","Processing asent: Because he wasnt as strong?\n","Processing asent: Because what it held was different from the revenants that had been unwise enough to seek him out?\n","Processing asent: Both?\n","Processing asent: He didnt know.\n","Processing asent: He only knew that it was leaky.\n","Processing asent: When he opened it, what was inside might kill him.\n","Processing asent: What do you mean?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked.\n","Processing asent: Huh?\n","Processing asent: Dan looked around.\n","Processing asent: One hand was pressed to his stomach.\n","Processing asent: It hurt very badly now.\n","Processing asent: You just said, There isnt any choice.\n","Processing asent: What did you mean?\n","Processing asent: Never mind.\n","Processing asent: They had reached the picnic area, and Billy was turning in.\n","Processing asent: Up ahead was a clearing with picnic benches and barbecue pits.\n","Processing asent: To Dan, it looked like Cloud Gap without the river.\n","Processing asent: Just . . . if things go wrong, get in your truck and drive like hell.\n","Processing asent: You think that would help?\n","Processing asent: Dan didnt reply.\n","Processing asent: His gut was burning, burning.\n","Processing asent: Shortly before four oclock on that Monday afternoon in late September, Rose walked up to Roof O the World with Silent Sarey.\n","Processing asent: Rose was dressed in form-fitting jeans that accentuated her long and shapely legs.\n","Processing asent: Although it was chilly, Silent Sarey wore only a housedress of unremarkable light blue that fluttered around stout calves clad in Jobst support stockings.\n","Processing asent: Rose stopped to look at a plaque which had been bolted to a granite post at the base of the three dozen or so stairs leading up to the lookout platform.\n","Processing asent: It announced that this was the site of the historic Overlook Hotel, which had burned to the ground some thirty-five years ago.\n","Processing asent: Very strong feelings here, Sarey.\n","Processing asent: Sarey nodded.\n","Processing asent: You know there are hot springs where steam comes right out of the ground, dont you?\n","Processing asent: This is like that.\n","Processing asent: Rose bent down to sniff at the grass and wildflowers.\n","Processing asent: Below their aromas was the iron smell of ancient blood.\n","Processing asent: Strong emotionshatred, fear, prejudice, lust.\n","Processing asent: The echo of murder.\n","Processing asent: Not foodtoo oldbut refreshing, all the same.\n","Processing asent: A heady bouquet.\n","Processing asent: Sarey said nothing, but watched Rose closely.\n","Processing asent: And this thing.\n","Processing asent: Rose waved a hand at the steep wooden stairs leading up to the platform.\n","Processing asent: Looks like a gallows, dont you think?\n","Processing asent: All it needs is a trapdoor.\n","Processing asent: Nothing from Sarey.\n","Processing asent: Out loud, at least.\n","Processing asent: Her thought\n","Processing asent: was clear enough.\n","Processing asent: Thats true, my love, but one of us is going to hang here, just the same.\n","Processing asent: Either me or the little bitch with her nose in our business.\n","Processing asent: See that?\n","Processing asent: Rose pointed to a small green shed about twenty feet away.\n","Processing asent: Sarey nodded.\n","Processing asent: Rose was wearing a zipper pack on her belt.\n","Processing asent: She opened it, rummaged, brought out a key, and handed it to the other woman.\n","Processing asent: Sarey walked to the shed, grass whickering against her thick flesh-colored hose.\n","Processing asent: The key fitted a padlock on the door.\n","Processing asent: When she pulled the door open, late-day sunshine illuminated an enclosure not much bigger than a privy.\n","Processing asent: There was a Lawn-Boy and a plastic bucket holding a hand-sickle and a rake.\n","Processing asent: A spade and a pickax leaned against the back wall.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing else, and nothing to hide behind.\n","Processing asent: Go on in, Rose said.\n","Processing asent: Lets see what you can do.\n","Processing asent: And with all that steam inside you, you should be able to amaze me.\n","Processing asent: Like other members of the True Knot, Silent Sarey had her little talent.\n","Processing asent: She stepped into the little shed, sniffed, and said: Dusty.\n","Processing asent: Never mind the dust.\n","Processing asent: Lets see you do your thing.\n","Processing asent: Or rather, lets not see you.\n","Processing asent: For that was Sareys talent.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt capable of invisibility (none of them was), but she could create a kind of dimness that went very well with her unremarkable face and figure.\n","Processing asent: She turned to Rose, then looked down at her shadow.\n","Processing asent: She movednot much, only half a stepand her shadow merged with the one thrown by the handle of the Lawn-Boy.\n","Processing asent: Then she became perfectly still, and the shed was empty.\n","Processing asent: Rose squeezed her eyes shut, then popped them wide open, and there was Sarey, standing beside the mower with her hands folded demurely at her waist like a shy girl hoping some boy at the party will ask her to dance.\n","Processing asent: Rose looked away at the mountains, and when she looked back again the shed was emptyjust a tiny storage room with nowhere to hide.\n","Processing asent: In the strong sunlight there wasnt even a shadow.\n","Processing asent: Except for the one thrown by the mowers handle, that was.\n","Processing asent: Only\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Pull your elbow in, Rose said.\n","Processing asent: I see it.\n","Processing asent: Just a little.\n","Processing asent: Silent Sarey did as she was told and for a moment she was truly gone, at least until Rose concentrated.\n","Processing asent: When she did that, Sarey was there again.\n","Processing asent: But of course she knew Sarey was there.\n","Processing asent: When the time cameand it wouldnt be longthe bitchgirl wouldnt.\n","Processing asent: Good, Sarey! she said warmly (or as warmly as she could manage).\n","Processing asent: Perhaps I wont need you.\n","Processing asent: If I do, youll use the sickle.\n","Processing asent: And think of Andi when you do.\n","Processing asent: All right?\n","Processing asent: At the mention of Andis name, Sareys lips turned down in a moue of unhappiness.\n","Processing asent: She stared at the sickle in the plastic bucket and nodded.\n","Processing asent: Rose walked over and took the padlock.\n","Processing asent: Im going to lock you in now.\n","Processing asent: The bitchgirl will read the ones in the Lodge, but she wont read you.\n","Processing asent: Im sure of it.\n","Processing asent: Because youre the quiet one, arent you?\n","Processing asent: Sarey nodded again.\n","Processing asent: She was the quiet one, always had been.\n","Processing asent: (what about the)\n","Processing asent: Rose smiled.\n","Processing asent: The lock?\n","Processing asent: Dont you worry about that.\n","Processing asent: Just worry about being still.\n","Processing asent: Still and silent.\n","Processing asent: Do you understand me?\n","Processing asent: And you understand about the sickle?\n","Processing asent: Rose would not have trusted Sarey with a gun even if the True had one.\n","Processing asent: Sicka.\n","Processing asent: Lup.\n","Processing asent: If I get the better of herand as full of steam as I am right now, that should be no problemyoull stay right where you are until I let you out.\n","Processing asent: But if you hear me shout . . . lets see . . . if you hear me shout dont make me punish you, that means I need help.\n","Processing asent: Ill make sure that her back is turned.\n","Processing asent: You know what happens then, dont you?\n","Processing asent: (Ill climb the stairs and)\n","Processing asent: But Rose was shaking her head.\n","Processing asent: No, Sarey.\n","Processing asent: You wont need to.\n","Processing asent: Shes never going to get near the platform up there.\n","Processing asent: She would hate to lose the steam even more than she would hate losing the opportunity to kill the bitchgirl herself . . . after making her suffer, and at length.\n","Processing asent: But she mustnt throw caution to the winds.\n","Processing asent: The girl was very strong.\n","Processing asent: What will you listen for, Sarey?\n","Processing asent: Dont make me punish lu.\n","Processing asent: And what will you be thinking of?\n","Processing asent: The eyes, half-hidden by the shaggy bangs, gleamed.\n","Processing asent: Levenge.\n","Processing asent: Thats right.\n","Processing asent: Revenge for Andi, murdered by that bitchgirls friends.\n","Processing asent: But not unless I need you, because I want to do this myself.\n","Processing asent: Roses hands clenched, her nails digging into deep, blood-crusted crescents they had already made in her palms.\n","Processing asent: But if I need you, you come.\n","Processing asent: Dont hesitate or stop for anything.\n","Processing asent: Dont stop until youve put that sickle blade in her neck and see the end of it come out of her fucking throat.\n","Processing asent: Sareys eyes gleamed.\n","Processing asent: Lup.\n","Processing asent: Good.\n","Processing asent: Rose kissed her, then shut the door and snapped the padlock closed.\n","Processing asent: She put the key in her zipper pack and leaned against the door.\n","Processing asent: Listen to me, sweetheart.\n","Processing asent: If all goes well, youll get the first steam.\n","Processing asent: I promise.\n","Processing asent: And it will be the best you ever had.\n","Processing asent: Rose walked back to the lookout platform, took several long and steadying breaths, and then began to climb the steps.\n","Processing asent: Dan stood with his hands propped against one of the picnic tables, head down, eyes closed.\n","Processing asent: Doing it this way is crazy, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: I should stay with you.\n","Processing asent: You cant.\n","Processing asent: Youve got your own fish to fry.\n","Processing asent: What if you faint halfway down that path?\n","Processing asent: Even if you dont, how are you going to take on the whole bunch of them?\n","Processing asent: The way you look now, you couldnt go two rounds with a five-year-old.\n","Processing asent: I think pretty soon Im going to feel a whole lot better.\n","Processing asent: Stronger, too.\n","Processing asent: Go on, Billy.\n","Processing asent: You remember where to park?\n","Processing asent: Far end of the lot, by the sign that says kids eat for free when the Colorado teams win.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: Dan raised his head and noted the oversize sunglasses Billy was now wearing.\n","Processing asent: Pull your cap down hard.\n","Processing asent: All the way to your ears.\n","Processing asent: Look young.\n","Processing asent: I might have a trick thatll make me look even younger.\n","Processing asent: If I can still do it, that is.\n","Processing asent: Dan barely heard this.\n","Processing asent: I need one other thing.\n","Processing asent: He stood up straight and opened his arms.\n","Processing asent: Billy hugged him, wanting to do it hardfiercelyand not daring.\n","Processing asent: Abra made a good call.\n","Processing asent: I never would have gotten here without you.\n","Processing asent: Now take care of your business.\n","Processing asent: You take care of yours, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Im counting on you to drive the Thanksgiving run out to Cloud Gap.\n","Processing asent: Id like that, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Best model train set a boy never had.\n","Processing asent: Billy watched him walk slowly, holding his hands against his stomach as he went, to the signpost on the far side of the clearing.\n","Processing asent: There were two wooden arrows.\n","Processing asent: One pointed west, toward Pawnee Lookout.\n","Processing asent: The other pointed east, downhill.\n","Processing asent: This one read TO BLUEBELL CAMPGROUND.\n","Processing asent: Dan started along that path.\n","Processing asent: For a little while Billy could see him through the glowing yellow leaves of the aspens, walking slowly and painfully, his head down to watch his footing.\n","Processing asent: Then he was gone.\n","Processing asent: Take care of my boy, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: He wasnt sure if he was talking to God or Abra, and guessed it didnt matter; both were probably too busy to bother with the likes of him this afternoon.\n","Processing asent: He went back to his truck, and from the bed pulled out a little girl with staring china blue eyes and stiff blond curls.\n","Processing asent: Not much weight; she was probably hollow inside.\n","Processing asent: How you doin, Abra?\n","Processing asent: Hope you didnt get bumped around too much.\n","Processing asent: She was wearing a Colorado Rockies tee and blue shorts.\n","Processing asent: Her feet were bare, and why not?\n","Processing asent: This little girlactually a mannequin purchased at a moribund childrens clothing shop in Martenvillehad never walked a single step.\n","Processing asent: But she had bendable knees, and Billy was able to place her in the trucks passenger seat with no trouble.\n","Processing asent: He buckled her seatbelt, started to close the door, then tried the neck.\n","Processing asent: It also bent, although only a little.\n","Processing asent: He stepped away to examine the effect.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt bad.\n","Processing asent: She seemed to be looking at something in her lap.\n","Processing asent: Or maybe praying for strength in the coming battle.\n","Processing asent: Not bad at all.\n","Processing asent: Unless they had binoculars, of course.\n","Processing asent: He got back in the truck and waited, giving Dan time.\n","Processing asent: Also hoping he wasnt passed out somewhere along the path that led to the Bluebell Campground.\n","Processing asent: At quarter to five, Billy started the truck and headed back the way he had come.\n","Processing asent: Dan maintained a steady walking pace in spite of the growing heat in his midsection.\n","Processing asent: It felt as though there were a rat on fire in there, one that kept chewing at him even as it burned.\n","Processing asent: If the path had been going up instead of down, he never would have made it.\n","Processing asent: At ten to five, he came around a bend and stopped.\n","Processing asent: Not far ahead, the aspens gave way to a green and manicured expanse of lawn sloping down to a pair of tennis courts.\n","Processing asent: Beyond the courts he could see the RV parking area and a long log building: Overlook Lodge.\n","Processing asent: Beyond that, the terrain climbed again.\n","Processing asent: Where the Overlook had once stood, a tall platform reared gantrylike against the bright sky.\n","Processing asent: Roof O the World.\n","Processing asent: Looking at it, the same thought that had occurred to Rose the Hat\n","Processing asent: crossed Dans mind.\n","Processing asent: Standing at the railing, facing south toward the parking lot for day visitors, was a single silhouetted figure.\n","Processing asent: A womans figure.\n","Processing asent: The tophat was tilted on her head.\n","Processing asent: (Abra are you there)\n","Processing asent: (Im here Dan)\n","Processing asent: Calm, by the sound.\n","Processing asent: Calm was just the way he wanted it.\n","Processing asent: (are they hearing you)\n","Processing asent: That brought a vague ticklish sensation: her smile.\n","Processing asent: The angry one.\n","Processing asent: (if theyre not theyre deaf)\n","Processing asent: That was good enough.\n","Processing asent: (you have to come to me now but remember if I tell you to go YOU GO)\n","Processing asent: She didnt answer, and before he could tell her again, she was there.\n","Processing asent: The Stones and John Dalton watched helplessly as Abra slid sideways until she was lying with her head on the boards of the stoop and her legs splayed out on the steps below her.\n","Processing asent: Hoppy spilled from one relaxing hand.\n","Processing asent: She didnt look as if she were sleeping, nor even in a faint.\n","Processing asent: That was the ugly sprawl of deep unconsciousness or death.\n","Processing asent: Lucy lunged forward.\n","Processing asent: Dave and John held her back.\n","Processing asent: She fought them.\n","Processing asent: Let me go!\n","Processing asent: I have to help her!\n","Processing asent: You cant, John said.\n","Processing asent: Only Dan can help her now.\n","Processing asent: They have to help each other.\n","Processing asent: She stared at him with wild eyes.\n","Processing asent: Is she even breathing?\n","Processing asent: Can you tell?\n","Processing asent: Shes breathing, Dave said, but he sounded unsure even to himself.\n","Processing asent: When Abra joined him, the pain eased for the first time since Boston.\n","Processing asent: That didnt comfort Dan much, because now Abra was suffering, too.\n","Processing asent: He could see it in her face, but he could also see the wonder in her eyes as she looked around at the room in which she found herself.\n","Processing asent: There were bunk beds, knotty-pine walls, and a rug embroidered with western sage and cactus.\n","Processing asent: Both the rug and the lower bunk were littered with cheap toys.\n","Processing asent: On a small desk in the corner was a scattering of books and a jigsaw puzzle with large pieces.\n","Processing asent: In the rooms far corner, a radiator clanked and hissed.\n","Processing asent: Abra walked to the desk and picked up one of the books.\n","Processing asent: On the cover, a small child on a trike was being chased by a little dog.\n","Processing asent: The title was Reading Fun with Dick and Jane.\n","Processing asent: Dan joined her, wearing a bemused smile.\n","Processing asent: The little girl on the cover is Sally.\n","Processing asent: Dick and Jane are her brother and sister.\n","Processing asent: And the dogs name is Jip.\n","Processing asent: For a little while they were my best friends.\n","Processing asent: My only friends, I guess.\n","Processing asent: Except for Tony, of course.\n","Processing asent: She put the book down and turned to him.\n","Processing asent: What is this place, Dan?\n","Processing asent: A memory.\n","Processing asent: There used to be a hotel here, and this was my room.\n","Processing asent: Now its a place where we can be together.\n","Processing asent: You know the wheel that turns when you go into someone else?\n","Processing asent: Uh-huh\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: This is the middle.\n","Processing asent: The hub.\n","Processing asent: I wish we could stay here.\n","Processing asent: It feels . . . safe.\n","Processing asent: Except for those.\n","Processing asent: Abra pointed to the French doors with their long panes of glass.\n","Processing asent: They dont feel the same as the rest.\n","Processing asent: She looked at him almost accusingly.\n","Processing asent: They werent here, were they?\n","Processing asent: When you were a kid.\n","Processing asent: There werent any windows in my room, and the only door was the one that went into the rest of the caretakers apartment.\n","Processing asent: I changed it.\n","Processing asent: I had to.\n","Processing asent: Do you know why?\n","Processing asent: She studied him, her eyes grave.\n","Processing asent: Because that was then and this is now.\n","Processing asent: Because the past is gone, even though it defines the present.\n","Processing asent: He smiled.\n","Processing asent: I couldnt have said it better myself.\n","Processing asent: You didnt have to say it.\n","Processing asent: You thought it.\n","Processing asent: He drew her toward those French doors that had never existed.\n","Processing asent: Through the glass they could see the lawn, the tennis courts, the Overlook Lodge, and Roof O the World.\n","Processing asent: I see her, Abra breathed.\n","Processing asent: Shes up there, and shes not looking this way, is she?\n","Processing asent: She better not be, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: How bad is the pain, honey?\n","Processing asent: Bad, she said.\n","Processing asent: But I dont care.\n","Processing asent: Because\n","Processing asent: She didnt have to finish.\n","Processing asent: He knew, and she smiled.\n","Processing asent: This togetherness was what they had, and in spite of the pain that came with itpain of all kindsit was good.\n","Processing asent: It was very good.\n","Processing asent: Yes, honey.\n","Processing asent: There are ghostie people out there.\n","Processing asent: I cant see them, but I feel them.\n","Processing asent: Do you?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: He had for years.\n","Processing asent: Because the past defines the present.\n","Processing asent: He put his arm around her shoulders, and her arm crept around his waist.\n","Processing asent: What do we do now?\n","Processing asent: Wait for Billy.\n","Processing asent: Hope hes on time.\n","Processing asent: And then all of this is going to happen very fast.\n","Processing asent: Uncle Dan?\n","Processing asent: What, Abra.\n","Processing asent: Whats inside you?\n","Processing asent: That isnt a ghost.\n","Processing asent: Its like He felt her shiver.\n","Processing asent: Its like a monster.\n","Processing asent: He said nothing.\n","Processing asent: She straightened and stepped away from him.\n","Processing asent: Look!\n","Processing asent: Over there!\n","Processing asent: An old Ford pickup was rolling into the visitors parking lot.\n","Processing asent: Rose stood with her hands on the lookout platforms waist-high railing, peering at the truck pulling into the parking lot.\n","Processing asent: The steam had sharpened her vision, but she still wished she had brought a pair of binoculars.\n","Processing asent: Surely there were some in the supply room, for guests who wanted to go bird-watching, so why hadnt she?\n","Processing asent: Because you had so many other things on your mind.\n","Processing asent: The sickness . . . the rats jumping ship . . . losing Crow to the bitchgirl\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: Yes to all of thatyes, yes, yesbut she still should have remembered.\n","Processing asent: For a moment she wondered what else she might have forgotten, but pushed the idea away.\n","Processing asent: She was still in charge of this, loaded with steam and at the top of her game.\n","Processing asent: Everything was going exactly as planned.\n","Processing asent: Soon the little girl would come up here, because she was full of foolish teenage confidence and pride in her own abilities.\n","Processing asent: But I have the high ground, dear, in all sorts of ways.\n","Processing asent: If I cant take care of you alone, Ill draw from the rest of the True.\n","Processing asent: Theyre all together in the main room, because you thought that was such a good idea.\n","Processing asent: But theres something you didnt take into consideration.\n","Processing asent: When were together were linked, were a True Knot, and that makes us a giant battery.\n","Processing asent: Power I can draw on if I need to.\n","Processing asent: If all else failed, there was Silent Sarey.\n","Processing asent: She would now have the sickle in her hand.\n","Processing asent: She might not be a genius, but she was merciless, murderous, andonce she understood the jobcompletely obedient.\n","Processing asent: Also, she had her own reasons for wanting the bitchgirl laid out dead on the ground at the foot of the lookout platform.\n","Processing asent: Token Charlie hit her back at once, and although he was ordinarily a feeble sender, nowboosted by the others in the main room of the Lodgehe came in loud and clear and nearly mad with excitement.\n","Processing asent: (Im getting her steady and strong we all are she must be real close you must feel her)\n","Processing asent: Rose did, even though she was still working hard to keep her mind closed off so the bitchgirl couldnt get in and mess with her.\n","Processing asent: (never mind that just tell the others to be ready if I need help)\n","Processing asent: Many voices came back, jumping all over each other.\n","Processing asent: They were ready.\n","Processing asent: Even those that were sick were ready to help all they could.\n","Processing asent: She loved them for that.\n","Processing asent: Rose stared at the blond girl in the truck.\n","Processing asent: She was looking down.\n","Processing asent: Reading something?\n","Processing asent: Nerving herself up?\n","Processing asent: Praying to the God of Rubes, perhaps?\n","Processing asent: It didnt matter.\n","Processing asent: Come to me, bitchgirl.\n","Processing asent: Come to Auntie Rose.\n","Processing asent: But it wasnt the girl who got out, it was the uncle.\n","Processing asent: Just as the bitch had said he would.\n","Processing asent: Checking.\n","Processing asent: He walked around the hood of the truck, moving slowly, looking everywhere.\n","Processing asent: He leaned in the passenger window, said something to the girl, then moved away from the truck a little.\n","Processing asent: He looked toward the Lodge, then turned to the platform rearing against the sky . . . and waved.\n","Processing asent: The insolent bugger actually waved at her.\n","Processing asent: Rose didnt wave back.\n","Processing asent: She was frowning.\n","Processing asent: An uncle.\n","Processing asent: Why had her parents sent an uncle instead of bringing their bitch daughter themselves?\n","Processing asent: For that matter, why had they allowed her to come at all?\n","Processing asent: She convinced them it was the only way.\n","Processing asent: Told them that if she didnt come to me, Id come to her.\n","Processing asent: Thats the reason, and it makes sense.\n","Processing asent: It did, but she felt a growing unease all the same.\n","Processing asent: She had allowed the bitchgirl to set the ground rules.\n","Processing asent: To that extent, at least, Rose had been manipulated.\n","Processing asent: She had allowed it because this was her home ground and because she had taken precautions, but mostly because she had been angry.\n","Processing asent: So angry.\n","Processing asent: She stared hard at the man in the parking lot.\n","Processing asent: He was strolling around again, looking here and there, making sure she was alone.\n","Processing asent: Perfectly reasonable, it was what she would have done, but she still had a gnawing intuition that what he was really doing was buying time, although why he would want to was beyond her.\n","Processing asent: Rose stared harder, now focusing on the mans gait.\n","Processing asent: She decided he wasnt as young as she had first believed.\n","Processing asent: He walked, in fact, like a man who was far from young.\n","Processing asent: As if he had more than a touch of arthritis.\n","Processing asent: And why was the little girl so still?\n","Processing asent: Rose felt the first pulse of real alarm.\n","Processing asent: Something was wrong here.\n","Processing asent: Shes looking at Mr. Freeman, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: We should go.\n","Processing asent: He opened the French doors, but hesitated.\n","Processing asent: Something in her voice.\n","Processing asent: Whats the trouble, Abra?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: Maybe nothing, but I dont like it.\n","Processing asent: Shes looking at him really hard.\n","Processing asent: We have to go right now.\n","Processing asent: I need to do something first.\n","Processing asent: Try to be ready, and dont be scared.\n","Processing asent: Dan closed his eyes and went to the storage room at the back of his mind.\n","Processing asent: Real lockboxes would have been covered with dust after all these years, but the two hed put here as a child were as fresh as ever.\n","Processing asent: Why not?\n","Processing asent: They were made of pure imagination.\n","Processing asent: The thirdthe new onehad a faint aura hanging around it, and he thought: No wonder Im sick.\n","Processing asent: Never mind.\n","Processing asent: That one had to stay for the time being.\n","Processing asent: He opened the oldest of the other two, ready for anything, and found . . . nothing.\n","Processing asent: Or almost.\n","Processing asent: In the lockbox that had held Mrs. Massey for thirty-two years, there was a heap of dark gray ash.\n","Processing asent: But in the other\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: He realized how foolish telling her not to be scared had been.\n","Processing asent: Abra shrieked.\n","Processing asent: On the back stoop of the house in Anniston, Abra began to jerk.\n","Processing asent: Her legs spasmed; her feet rattled a tattoo on the steps; one handflopping like a fish dragged to a riverbank and left to die theresent the ill-used and bedraggled Hoppy flying.\n","Processing asent: Whats wrong with her?\n","Processing asent: Lucy screamed.\n","Processing asent: She rushed for the door.\n","Processing asent: David stood frozentransfixed by the sight of his seizing daughterbut John got his right arm around Lucys waist and his left around her upper chest.\n","Processing asent: She bucked against him.\n","Processing asent: Let me go!\n","Processing asent: I have to go to her!\n","Processing asent: John shouted.\n","Processing asent: No, Lucy, you cant!\n","Processing asent: She would have broken free, but now David had her, too.\n","Processing asent: She subsided, looking first at John.\n","Processing asent: If she dies out there, Ill see you go to jail for it.\n","Processing asent: Next, her gazeflat-eyed and hostilewent to her husband.\n","Processing asent: You Ill never forgive.\n","Processing asent: Shes quieting, John said.\n","Processing asent: On the stoop, Abras tremors moderated, then stopped.\n","Processing asent: But her cheeks were wet, and tears squeezed from beneath her closed lids.\n","Processing asent: In the days dying light, they clung to her lashes like jewels.\n","Processing asent: In Danny Torrances childhood bedrooma room now made only of memoryAbra clung to Dan with her face pressed against his chest.\n","Processing asent: When she spoke, her voice was muffled.\n","Processing asent: The monsteris it gone?\n","Processing asent: Yes, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Swear on your mothers name?\n","Processing asent: She raised her head, first looking at him to assure herself he was telling the truth, then daring to scan the room.\n","Processing asent: That smile.\n","Processing asent: She shuddered.\n","Processing asent: Yes, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: I think . . . hes glad to be home.\n","Processing asent: Abra, are you going to be all right?\n","Processing asent: Because we have to do this right now.\n","Processing asent: Times up.\n","Processing asent: Im all right.\n","Processing asent: But what if . . . it . . . comes back?\n","Processing asent: Dan thought of the lockbox.\n","Processing asent: It was open, but could be closed again easily enough.\n","Processing asent: Especially with Abra to help him.\n","Processing asent: I dont think he . . . it . . . wants anything to do with us, honey.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Just remember: if I tell you to go back to New Hampshire, you go.\n","Processing asent: Once again she didnt reply, and there was no time to discuss it.\n","Processing asent: Time was up.\n","Processing asent: He stepped through the French doors.\n","Processing asent: They gave on the end of the path.\n","Processing asent: Abra walked beside him, but lost the solidity shed had in the room of memory and began to flicker again.\n","Processing asent: Out here shes almost a ghostie person herself, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: It brought home to him just how much she had put herself at risk.\n","Processing asent: He didnt like to think about how tenuous her hold on her own body might now be.\n","Processing asent: Moving rapidlybut not running; that would attract Roses eye, and they had at least seventy yards to cover before the rear of the Overlook Lodge would block them from the lookout platformDan and his ghostie-girl companion crossed the lawn and took the flagstone walk that ran between the tennis courts.\n","Processing asent: They reached the back of the kitchen, and at last the bulk of the Lodge hid them from the platform.\n","Processing asent: Here was the steady rumble of an exhaust fan and the spoiled-meat smell of garbage cans.\n","Processing asent: He tried the rear door and found it unlocked, but paused a moment before opening it.\n","Processing asent: (are they all)\n","Processing asent: (yes all but Rose she hurry up Dan you have to because)\n","Processing asent: Abras eyes, flickering like those of a child in an old black-and-white movie, were wide with dismay.\n","Processing asent: She knows somethings wrong.\n","Processing asent: Rose turned her attention to the bitchgirl, still sitting in the passenger seat of the truck, head bowed, still as could be.\n","Processing asent: Abra wasnt watching her uncleif he was her uncleand she was making no move to get out.\n","Processing asent: The alarm meter in Roses head went from Danger Yellow to Condition Red.\n","Processing asent: Hey!\n","Processing asent: The voice came floating up to her on the thin air.\n","Processing asent: Hey, you old bag!\n","Processing asent: Watch this!\n","Processing asent: She snapped her gaze back to the man in the parking lot and stared, close to flabbergasted, as he raised his hands over his head and then turned a big, unsteady cartwheel.\n","Processing asent: She thought he was going to go on his ass, but the only thing that fell to the pavement was his hat.\n","Processing asent: What it exposed was the fine white hair of a man in his seventies.\n","Processing asent: Maybe even his eighties.\n","Processing asent: Rose looked back at the girl in the truck, who remained perfectly still with her head bent.\n","Processing asent: She had absolutely no interest in the uncles antics.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly it clicked and Rose understood what she would have seen right away, had the trick not been so outrageous: it was a mannequin.\n","Processing asent: But shes here!\n","Processing asent: Token Charlie feels her, all of them in the Lodge feel her, theyre all together and they know\n","Processing asent: All together in the Lodge.\n","Processing asent: All together in one place.\n","Processing asent: And had that been Roses idea?\n","Processing asent: That idea had come from the\n","Processing asent: Rose broke for the stairs.\n","Processing asent: The remaining members of the True Knot were crowded together at the two windows looking down at the parking lot, watching as Billy Freeman turned a cartwheel for the first time in over forty years (and the last time hed done this trick, hed been drunk).\n","Processing asent: Petty the Chink actually laughed.\n","Processing asent: What in Gods name\n","Processing asent: With their backs turned, they didnt see Dan step into the room from the kitchen, or the girl flickering in and out of view at his side.\n","Processing asent: Dan had time to register two bundles of clothes on the floor, and to understand that Bradley Trevors measles were still hard at work.\n","Processing asent: Then he went back inside himself, went deep, and found the third lockboxthe leaky one.\n","Processing asent: He flung it open.\n","Processing asent: (Dan what are you doing)\n","Processing asent: He leaned forward with his hands on his upper thighs, his stomach burning like hot metal, and exhaled the old poets last gasp, which she had given him freely, in a dying kiss.\n","Processing asent: From his mouth there came a long plume of pink mist that deepened to red as it hit the air.\n","Processing asent: At first he could focus on nothing but the blessed relief in the middle of his body as the poison remains of Concetta Reynolds left him.\n","Processing asent: Momo!\n","Processing asent: Abra shrieked.\n","Processing asent: On the platform, Roses eyes widened.\n","Processing asent: The bitchgirl was in the Lodge.\n","Processing asent: And someone was with her.\n","Processing asent: She leaped into this new mind without thinking about it.\n","Processing asent: Searching.\n","Processing asent: Ignoring the markers that meant big steam, only trying to stop him before he could do whatever it was he intended to do.\n","Processing asent: Ignoring the terrible possibility that it was already too late.\n","Processing asent: The members of the True turned toward Abras cry.\n","Processing asent: Someoneit was Long Paulsaid: What in the hell is that?\n","Processing asent: The red mist coalesced into a shape of a woman.\n","Processing asent: For a momentsurely no more than thatDan looked into Concettas swirling eyes and saw they were young.\n","Processing asent: Still weak and focused on this phantom, he had no sense of the intruder in his mind.\n","Processing asent: Momo!\n","Processing asent: Abra cried again.\n","Processing asent: She was holding out her arms.\n","Processing asent: The woman in the cloud might have looked at her.\n","Processing asent: Might even have smiled.\n","Processing asent: Then the shape of Concetta Reynolds was gone and the mist rolled at the clustered True Knot, many of them now clinging to one another in fright and bewilderment.\n","Processing asent: To Dan, the red stuff looked like blood spreading in water.\n","Processing asent: Its steam, Dan told them.\n","Processing asent: You bastards lived on it; now suck it in and die on it.\n","Processing asent: He had known ever since the plans conception that if it didnt happen fast, he would never live to see how well it succeeded, but he had never imagined it would occur as rapidly as it did.\n","Processing asent: The measles that had already weakened them might have had something to do with it, because some lasted a little longer than others.\n","Processing asent: Even so, it was over in a matter of seconds.\n","Processing asent: They howled in his head like dying wolves.\n","Processing asent: The sound appalled Dan, but this was not true of his companion.\n","Processing asent: Good!\n","Processing asent: Abra shouted.\n","Processing asent: She shook her fists at them.\n","Processing asent: How does it taste?\n","Processing asent: How does my momo taste?\n","Processing asent: Is she good?\n","Processing asent: Have as much as you want!\n","Processing asent: HAVE ALL OF IT!\n","Processing asent: They began to cycle.\n","Processing asent: Through the red mist, Dan saw two of them embracing with their foreheads pressed together, and in spite of all they had doneall they werethe sight moved him.\n","Processing asent: He saw the words I love you on Short Eddies lips; saw Big Mo begin to reply; then they were gone, their clothes floating to the floor.\n","Processing asent: It was that quick.\n","Processing asent: He turned to Abra, meaning to tell her they had to finish it at once, but then Rose the Hat began to shriek, and for a few momentsuntil Abra could block herthose cries of rage and maddened grief blotted out everything else, even the blessed relief of being pain-free.\n","Processing asent: And, he devoutly hoped, cancer-free.\n","Processing asent: About that he wouldnt know for sure until he could see his face in a mirror.\n","Processing asent: Rose was at the head of the steps leading down from the platform when the killing mist rolled over the True Knot, the remains of Abras momo doing its quick and lethal work.\n","Processing asent: A white sheet of agony filled her.\n","Processing asent: Screams shot through her head like shrapnel.\n","Processing asent: The cries of the dying True made those of the Cloud Gap raiding party in New Hampshire and Crow in New York seem puny by comparison.\n","Processing asent: Rose staggered back as if she had been hit with a club.\n","Processing asent: She struck the railing, rebounded, and fell down on the boards.\n","Processing asent: Somewhere in the distance, a womanan old one, by the wavering sound of her voicewas chanting no, no, no, no, no.\n","Processing asent: Thats me.\n","Processing asent: It has to be, because Im the only one left.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt the girl who had fallen into the trap of overconfidence, but Rose herself.\n","Processing asent: She thought of something\n","Processing asent: (hoisted on your own petard)\n","Processing asent: the bitchgirl had said.\n","Processing asent: It scalded her with rage and dismay.\n","Processing asent: Her old friends and longtime traveling companions were dead.\n","Processing asent: Poisoned.\n","Processing asent: Except for the cowards who had run, Rose the Hat was the last of the True Knot.\n","Processing asent: But no, that wasnt true.\n","Processing asent: There was Sarey.\n","Processing asent: Sprawled on the platform and shivering under the late-afternoon sky, Rose reached out to her.\n","Processing asent: The thought that came back was full of confusion and horror.\n","Processing asent: (yes but Rose are they can they be)\n","Processing asent: (never mind them just remember Sarey do you remember)\n","Processing asent: (dont make me punish you)\n","Processing asent: (good Sarey good)\n","Processing asent: If the girl didnt run . . . if she made the mistake of trying to finish her murderous days work\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: She would.\n","Processing asent: Rose was sure of it, and she had seen enough in the mind of the bitchgirls companion to know two things: how they had accomplished this slaughter, and how their very connection could be turned against them.\n","Processing asent: Rage was powerful.\n","Processing asent: So were childhood memories.\n","Processing asent: She struggled to her feet, reset her hat at the proper jaunty angle without even thinking about it, and walked to the railing.\n","Processing asent: The man from the pickup truck was staring up at her, but she paid scant attention to him.\n","Processing asent: His treacherous little job was done.\n","Processing asent: She might deal with him later, but now she had eyes only for the Overlook Lodge.\n","Processing asent: The girl was there, but also far away.\n","Processing asent: Her bodily presence at the Trues campground was little more than a phantom.\n","Processing asent: The one who was wholea real person, a rubewas a man she had never seen before.\n","Processing asent: And a steamhead.\n","Processing asent: His voice in her mind was clear and cold.\n","Processing asent: (hello Rose)\n","Processing asent: There was a place nearby where the girl would cease to flicker.\n","Processing asent: Where she would take on her physical body.\n","Processing asent: Where she could be killed.\n","Processing asent: Let Sarey take care of the steamhead man, but not until the steamhead man had taken care of the bitchgirl.\n","Processing asent: (hello Danny hello little boy)\n","Processing asent: Loaded with steam, she reached into him and swatted him to the hub of the wheel, barely hearing Abras cry of bewilderment and terror as she turned to follow.\n","Processing asent: And when Dan was where Rose wanted him, for a moment too surprised to keep his guard up, she poured all her fury into him.\n","Processing asent: She poured it into him like steam.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER TWENTY\n","Processing asent: HUB OF THE WHEEL, ROOF O THE WORLD\n","Processing asent: Dan Torrance opened his eyes.\n","Processing asent: Sunlight shot through them and into his aching head, threatening to set his brains on fire.\n","Processing asent: It was the hangover to end all hangovers.\n","Processing asent: Loud snoring from beside him: a nasty, annoying sound that could only be some drunk chick sleeping it off at the wrong end of the rainbow.\n","Processing asent: Dan turned his head that way and saw the woman sprawled on her back beside him.\n","Processing asent: Vaguely familiar.\n","Processing asent: Dark hair spread around her in a halo.\n","Processing asent: Wearing an oversize Atlanta Braves t-shirt.\n","Processing asent: This isnt real.\n","Processing asent: Im not here.\n","Processing asent: Im in Colorado, Im at Roof O the World, and I have to end it.\n","Processing asent: The woman rolled over, opened her eyes, and stared at him.\n","Processing asent: God, my head, she said.\n","Processing asent: Get me some of that coke, daddy.\n","Processing asent: Its in the living room.\n","Processing asent: He stared at her in amazement and growing fury.\n","Processing asent: The fury seemed to come from nowhere, but hadnt it always been that way?\n","Processing asent: It was its own thing, a riddle wrapped in an enigma.\n","Processing asent: Coke?\n","Processing asent: Who bought coke?\n","Processing asent: She grinned, revealing a mouth that contained only a single discolored tooth.\n","Processing asent: Then he knew who she was.\n","Processing asent: You did, daddy.\n","Processing asent: Now go get it.\n","Processing asent: Once my heads clear, Ill throw you a nice fuck.\n","Processing asent: Somehow he was back in this sleazy Wilmington apartment, naked, next to Rose the Hat.\n","Processing asent: What have you done?\n","Processing asent: How did I get here?\n","Processing asent: She threw her head back and laughed.\n","Processing asent: Dont you like this place?\n","Processing asent: You should; I furnished it from your own head.\n","Processing asent: Now do what I told you, asshole.\n","Processing asent: Get the fucking blow.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Abra?\n","Processing asent: What did you do with Abra?\n","Processing asent: Killed her, Rose said indifferently.\n","Processing asent: She was so worried about you she dropped her guard and I tore her open from throat to belly.\n","Processing asent: I wasnt able to suck up as much of her steam as I wanted, but I got quite a lo\n","Processing asent: The world went red.\n","Processing asent: Dan clamped his hands around her throat and began to choke.\n","Processing asent: One thought beat through his mind: worthless bitch, now youll take your medicine, worthless bitch, now youll take your medicine, worthless bitch, now youll take it all.\n","Processing asent: The steamhead man was powerful but had nothing like the girls juice.\n","Processing asent: He stood with his legs apart, his head lowered, his shoulders hunched, and his fisted hands raisedthe posture of every man who had ever lost his mind in a killing rage.\n","Processing asent: Anger made men easy.\n","Processing asent: It was impossible to follow his thoughts, because they had turned red.\n","Processing asent: That was all right, that was fine, the girl was right where Rose wanted her.\n","Processing asent: In Abras state of shocked dismay, she had followed him to the hub of the wheel.\n","Processing asent: She wouldnt be shocked or dismayed for much longer, though; Bitchgirl had become Choked Girl.\n","Processing asent: Soon she would be Dead Girl, hoisted on her own petard.\n","Processing asent: (Uncle Dan no no stop its not her)\n","Processing asent: It is, Rose thought, bearing down even harder.\n","Processing asent: Her tooth crept out of her mouth and skewered her lower lip.\n","Processing asent: Blood poured down her chin and onto her top.\n","Processing asent: She didnt feel it any more than she felt the mountain breeze blowing through her masses of dark hair.\n","Processing asent: It is me.\n","Processing asent: You were my daddy, my barroom daddy, I made you empty your wallet for a pile of bad coke, and now its the morning after and I need to take my medicine.\n","Processing asent: Its what you wanted to do when you woke up next to that drunken whore in Wilmington, what you would have done if youd had any balls, and her useless whelp of a son for good measure.\n","Processing asent: Your father knew how to deal with stupid, disobedient women, and his father before him.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes a woman just needs to take her medicine.\n","Processing asent: She needs\n","Processing asent: There was the roar of an approaching motor.\n","Processing asent: It was as unimportant as the pain in her lip and the taste of blood in her mouth.\n","Processing asent: The girl was choking, rattling.\n","Processing asent: Then a thought as loud as a thunderclap exploded in her brain, a wounded roar:\n","Processing asent: (MY FATHER KNEW NOTHING!)\n","Processing asent: Rose was still trying to clear her mind of that shout when Billy Freemans pickup truck hit the base of the lookout, knocking her off her feet.\n","Processing asent: Her hat went flying.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt the apartment in Wilmington.\n","Processing asent: It was his long-gone bedroom at the Overlook Hotelthe hub of the wheel.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt Deenie, the woman hed awakened next to in that apartment, and it wasnt Rose.\n","Processing asent: It was Abra.\n","Processing asent: He had his hands around her neck and her eyes were bulging.\n","Processing asent: For a moment she started to change again as Rose tried to worm back inside him, feeding him her rage and augmenting his own.\n","Processing asent: Then something happened, and she was gone.\n","Processing asent: But she would be back.\n","Processing asent: Abra was coughing and staring at him.\n","Processing asent: He would have expected shock, but for a girl who had almost been choked to death, she seemed oddly composed.\n","Processing asent: (well . . . we knew it wouldnt be easy)\n","Processing asent: Im not my father!\n","Processing asent: Dan shouted at her.\n","Processing asent: I am not my father!\n","Processing asent: Probably thats good, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: She actually smiled.\n","Processing asent: Youve got one hell of a temper, Uncle Dan.\n","Processing asent: I guess we really are related.\n","Processing asent: I almost killed you, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: Its enough.\n","Processing asent: Time for you to get out.\n","Processing asent: Go back to New Hampshire right now.\n","Processing asent: She shook her head.\n","Processing asent: Ill have tofor awhile, not longbut right now you need me.\n","Processing asent: Abra, thats an order.\n","Processing asent: She folded her arms and stood where she was on the cactus carpet.\n","Processing asent: Ah, Christ.\n","Processing asent: He ran his hands through his hair.\n","Processing asent: Youre a piece of work.\n","Processing asent: She reached out, took his hand.\n","Processing asent: Were going to finish this together.\n","Processing asent: Now come on.\n","Processing asent: Lets get out of this room.\n","Processing asent: I dont think I like it here, after all.\n","Processing asent: Their fingers interlaced, and the room where he had lived for a time as a child dissolved.\n","Processing asent: Dan had time to register the hood of Billys pickup folded around one of the thick posts holding up the Roof O the World lookout tower, its busted radiator steaming.\n","Processing asent: He saw the mannequin version of Abra hanging out the passenger-side window, with one plastic arm cocked jauntily behind her.\n","Processing asent: He saw Billy himself trying to open the crumpled drivers side door.\n","Processing asent: Blood was running down one side of the old mans face.\n","Processing asent: Something grabbed his head.\n","Processing asent: Powerful hands twisting, attempting to snap his neck.\n","Processing asent: Then Abras hands were there, tearing Roses away.\n","Processing asent: She looked up.\n","Processing asent: Youll have to do better than that, you cowardly old bitch.\n","Processing asent: Rose stood at the railing, looking down and resetting her ugly hat at the correct angle.\n","Processing asent: Did you enjoy your uncles hands around your throat?\n","Processing asent: How do you feel about him now?\n","Processing asent: That was you, not him.\n","Processing asent: Rose grinned, her bloody mouth yawning.\n","Processing asent: Not at all, dear.\n","Processing asent: I just made use of what he has inside.\n","Processing asent: You should know, youre just like him.\n","Processing asent: Shes trying to distract us, Dan thought.\n","Processing asent: But from what?\n","Processing asent: That?\n","Processing asent: It was a small green buildingmaybe an outside bathroom, maybe a storage shed.\n","Processing asent: He didnt have to finish the thought.\n","Processing asent: Abra turned toward the shed and stared at it.\n","Processing asent: The padlock creaked, snapped, and fell into the grass.\n","Processing asent: The door swung open.\n","Processing asent: The shed was empty except for a few tools and an old lawnmower.\n","Processing asent: Dan thought hed felt something there, but it must only have been overwrought nerves.\n","Processing asent: When they looked up again, Rose was no longer in view.\n","Processing asent: She had retreated from the railing.\n","Processing asent: Billy finally managed to get the door of his truck open.\n","Processing asent: He got out, staggered, managed to keep his feet.\n","Processing asent: Danny?\n","Processing asent: You all right?\n","Processing asent: And then: Is that Abra?\n","Processing asent: Jesus, shes hardly there.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Billy.\n","Processing asent: Can you walk to the Lodge?\n","Processing asent: I think so.\n","Processing asent: What about the people in there?\n","Processing asent: Gone.\n","Processing asent: I think it would be a very good idea if you went now.\n","Processing asent: Billy didnt argue.\n","Processing asent: He started down the slope, wallowing like a drunk.\n","Processing asent: Dan pointed at the stairs leading to the lookout platform and raised questioning eyebrows.\n","Processing asent: Abra shook her head\n","Processing asent: (its what she wants)\n","Processing asent: and began leading Dan around Roof O the World, to where they could see the very top of Roses stovepipe hat.\n","Processing asent: This put the little equipment shed at their backs, but Dan thought nothing of this now that he had seen it was empty.\n","Processing asent: (Dan I have to go back now just for a minute I have to refresh my)\n","Processing asent: A picture in his mind: a field filled with sunflowers, all opening at once.\n","Processing asent: She needed to take care of her physical being, and that was good.\n","Processing asent: That was right.\n","Processing asent: (Ill be back as soon as)\n","Processing asent: (go Abra Ill be fine)\n","Processing asent: And with any luck, this would be over when she came back.\n","Processing asent: In Anniston, John Dalton and the Stones saw Abra draw a deep breath and open her eyes.\n","Processing asent: Abra!\n","Processing asent: Lucy called.\n","Processing asent: Is it over?\n","Processing asent: Whats that on your neck?\n","Processing asent: Are those bruises?\n","Processing asent: Mom, stay there!\n","Processing asent: I have to go back.\n","Processing asent: Dan needs me.\n","Processing asent: She reached for Hoppy, but before she could grasp the old stuffed rabbit, her eyes closed and her body grew still.\n","Processing asent: Peering cautiously over the railing, Rose saw Abra disappear.\n","Processing asent: Little bitchgirl could only stay here so long, then she had to go back for some R & R. Her presence at the Bluebell Campground wasnt much different from her presence that day in the supermarket, only this manifestation was much more powerful.\n","Processing asent: And why?\n","Processing asent: Because the man was assisting her.\n","Processing asent: Boosting her.\n","Processing asent: If he were dead when the girl returned\n","Processing asent: Looking down at him, Rose called: Id leave while you still have the chance, Danny.\n","Processing asent: Dont make me punish you.\n","Processing asent: Silent Sarey was so focused on what was going on at Roof O the Worldlistening with every admittedly limited IQ point of her mind as well as with her earsthat she did not at first realize she was no longer alone in the shed.\n","Processing asent: It was the smell that finally alerted her: something rotten.\n","Processing asent: Not garbage.\n","Processing asent: She didnt dare turn, because the door was open and the man out there might see her.\n","Processing asent: She stood still, the sickle in one hand.\n","Processing asent: Sarey heard Rose telling the man to leave while he still had the chance, and that was when the shed door began swinging shut again, all on its own.\n","Processing asent: Dont make me punish you!\n","Processing asent: Rose called.\n","Processing asent: That was her cue to burst out and put the sickle in the troublesome, meddling little girls neck, but since the girl was gone, the man would have to do.\n","Processing asent: But before she could move, a cold hand slid over the wrist holding the sickle.\n","Processing asent: Slid over it and clamped tight.\n","Processing asent: She turnedno reason not to now, with the door closedand what she saw by the dim light filtering through the cracks in the old boards caused a scream to come bolting out of her usually silent throat.\n","Processing asent: At some point while she had been concentrating, a corpse had joined her in the toolshed.\n","Processing asent: His smiling, predatory face was the damp whitish-green of a spoiled avocado.\n","Processing asent: His eyes seemed almost to dangle from their sockets.\n","Processing asent: His suit was splotched with ancient mold . . . but the multicolored confetti sprinkled on his shoulders was fresh.\n","Processing asent: Great party, isnt it?\n","Processing asent: he said, and as he grinned, his lips split open.\n","Processing asent: She screamed again and drove the sickle into his left temple.\n","Processing asent: The curved blade went deep and hung there, but there was no blood.\n","Processing asent: Give us a kiss, dear, Horace Derwent said.\n","Processing asent: From between his lips came the wiggling white remnant of a tongue.\n","Processing asent: Its been a long time since Ive been with a woman.\n","Processing asent: As his tattered lips, shining with decay, settled on Sareys, his hands closed around her throat.\n","Processing asent: Rose saw the shed door swing closed, heard the scream, and understood that she was now truly alone.\n","Processing asent: Soon, probably in seconds, the girl would be back and it would be two against one.\n","Processing asent: She couldnt allow that.\n","Processing asent: She looked down at the man and summoned all of her steam-amplified force.\n","Processing asent: (choke yourself do it NOW)\n","Processing asent: His hands rose toward his throat, but too slowly.\n","Processing asent: He was fighting her, and with a degree of success that was infuriating.\n","Processing asent: She would have expected a battle from the bitchgirl, but that rube down there was an adult.\n","Processing asent: She should have been able to brush aside any steam remaining to him like mist.\n","Processing asent: Still, she was winning.\n","Processing asent: His hands went up to his chest . . . his shoulders . . . finally to his throat.\n","Processing asent: There they waveredshe could hear him panting with effort.\n","Processing asent: She bore down, and the hands gripped, shutting off his windpipe.\n","Processing asent: (thats right you interfering bastard squeeze squeeze and SQUEE)\n","Processing asent: Something hit her.\n","Processing asent: Not a fist; it felt more like a gust of tightly compressed air.\n","Processing asent: She looked around and saw nothing but a shimmer, there for a moment and then gone.\n","Processing asent: Less than three seconds, but enough to break her concentration, and when she turned back to the railing, the girl had returned.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt a gust of air this time; it was hands that felt simultaneously large and small.\n","Processing asent: They were in the small of her back.\n","Processing asent: They were pushing.\n","Processing asent: The bitchgirl and her friend, working togetherjust what Rose had wanted to avoid.\n","Processing asent: A worm of terror began to unwind in her stomach.\n","Processing asent: She tried to step back from the rail and could not.\n","Processing asent: It was taking all her strength just to stand pat, and with no supporting force from the True to help her, she didnt think shed be able to do that for long.\n","Processing asent: Not long at all.\n","Processing asent: If not for that gust of air . . . that wasnt him and she wasnt here\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: One of the hands left the small of her back and slapped the hat from her head.\n","Processing asent: Rose howled at the indignity of itnobody touched her hat, nobody!and for a moment summoned enough power to stagger back from the railing and toward the center of the platform.\n","Processing asent: Then those hands returned to the small of her back and began pushing her forward again.\n","Processing asent: She looked down at them.\n","Processing asent: The man had his eyes closed, concentrating so hard that the cords stood out on his neck and sweat rolled down his cheeks like tears.\n","Processing asent: The girls eyes, however, were wide and merciless.\n","Processing asent: She was staring up at Rose.\n","Processing asent: And she was smiling.\n","Processing asent: Rose pushed backward with all her strength, but she might have been pushing against a stone wall.\n","Processing asent: One that was moving her relentlessly forward, until her stomach was pressing against the rail.\n","Processing asent: She heard it creak.\n","Processing asent: She thought, for just a moment, of trying to bargain.\n","Processing asent: Of telling the girl that they could work together, start a new Knot.\n","Processing asent: That instead of dying in 2070 or 2080, Abra Stone could live a thousand years.\n","Processing asent: Two thousand.\n","Processing asent: But what good would it do?\n","Processing asent: Was there ever a teenage girl who felt anything less than immortal?\n","Processing asent: So instead of bargaining, or begging, she screamed defiance down at them.\n","Processing asent: Fuck you!\n","Processing asent: Fuck you both!\n","Processing asent: The girls terrible smile widened.\n","Processing asent: Oh, no, she said.\n","Processing asent: Youre the one whos fucked.\n","Processing asent: No creak this time; there was a crack like a rifleshot, and then Rose the Hatless was falling.\n","Processing asent: She hit the ground headfirst and began to cycle at once.\n","Processing asent: Her head was cocked (like her hat, Dan thought) on her shattered neck at an angle that was almost insouciant.\n","Processing asent: Dan held Abras handflesh that came and went in his own as she did her own cycling between her back stoop and Roof O the Worldand they watched together.\n","Processing asent: Does it hurt?\n","Processing asent: Abra asked the dying woman.\n","Processing asent: I hope it does.\n","Processing asent: I hope it hurts a lot.\n","Processing asent: Roses lips pulled back in a sneer.\n","Processing asent: Her human teeth were gone; all that remained was that single discolored tusk.\n","Processing asent: Above it, her eyes floated like living blue stones.\n","Processing asent: Then she was gone.\n","Processing asent: Abra turned to Dan.\n","Processing asent: She was still smiling, but now there was no anger or meanness in it.\n","Processing asent: (I was afraid for you I was afraid she might)\n","Processing asent: (she almost did but there was someone)\n","Processing asent: He pointed up to where the broken pieces of the railing jutted against the sky.\n","Processing asent: Abra looked there, then looked back at Dan, puzzled.\n","Processing asent: He could only shake his head.\n","Processing asent: It was her turn to point, not up but down.\n","Processing asent: (once there was a magician who had a hat like that his name was Mysterio)\n","Processing asent: (and you hung spoons on the ceiling)\n","Processing asent: She nodded but didnt raise her head.\n","Processing asent: She was still studying the hat.\n","Processing asent: (you need to get rid of it)\n","Processing asent: (burn it Mr. Freeman says he quit smoking but he still does I could smell it in the truck hell have matches)\n","Processing asent: You have to, she said.\n","Processing asent: Will you?\n","Processing asent: Do you promise?\n","Processing asent: (I love you Uncle Dan)\n","Processing asent: (love you too)\n","Processing asent: She hugged him.\n","Processing asent: He put his arms around her and hugged her back.\n","Processing asent: As he did, her body became rain.\n","Processing asent: Then mist.\n","Processing asent: Then gone.\n","Processing asent: On the back stoop of a house in Anniston, New Hampshire, in a dusk that would soon deepen to night, a little girl sat up, got to her feet, and then swayed, on the edge of a faint.\n","Processing asent: There was no chance of her falling down; her parents were there at once.\n","Processing asent: They carried her inside together.\n","Processing asent: Im okay, Abra said.\n","Processing asent: You can put me down.\n","Processing asent: They did, carefully.\n","Processing asent: David Stone stood close, ready to catch her at the slightest knee-buckle, but Abra stood steady in the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: What about Dan?\n","Processing asent: John asked.\n","Processing asent: Hes fine.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Freeman smashed up his truckhe had toand he got a cutshe put her hand to the side of his facebut I think hes okay.\n","Processing asent: And them?\n","Processing asent: The True Knot?\n","Processing asent: Abra raised a hand to her mouth and blew across the palm.\n","Processing asent: Gone.\n","Processing asent: And then: What is there to eat?\n","Processing asent: Im really hungry.\n","Processing asent: Fine might have been a bit of an overstatement in Dans case.\n","Processing asent: He walked to the truck, where he sat in the open drivers side door, getting his breath back.\n","Processing asent: And his wits.\n","Processing asent: We were on vacation, he decided.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to visit my old stomping grounds in Boulder.\n","Processing asent: Then we came up here to take in the view from Roof O the World, but the campground was deserted.\n","Processing asent: I was feeling frisky and bet Billy I could drive his truck straight up the hill to the lookout.\n","Processing asent: I was going too fast and lost control.\n","Processing asent: Hit one of the support posts.\n","Processing asent: Really sorry.\n","Processing asent: Damn fool stunt.\n","Processing asent: He would get hit with one hell of a fine, but there was an upside: he would pass the Breathalyzer with flying colors.\n","Processing asent: Dan looked in the glove compartment and found a can of lighter fluid.\n","Processing asent: No Zippothat would be in Billys pants pocketbut there were indeed two books of half-used matches.\n","Processing asent: He went to the hat and doused it with the lighter fluid until it was soaking.\n","Processing asent: Then he squatted, touched a match, and flicked it into the hats upturned bowl.\n","Processing asent: The hat didnt last long, but he moved upwind until it was nothing but ashes.\n","Processing asent: The smell was foul.\n","Processing asent: When he looked up, he saw Billy trudging toward him, wiping at his bloody face with his sleeve.\n","Processing asent: As they tromped through the ashes, making sure there wasnt a single ember that might spark a wildfire, Dan told him the story they would tell the Colorado State Police when they arrived.\n","Processing asent: Ill have to pay to have that thing repaired, and I bet it costs a bundle.\n","Processing asent: Good thing Ive got some savings.\n","Processing asent: Billy snorted.\n","Processing asent: Whos gonna chase you for damages?\n","Processing asent: Theres nothing left of those True Knot folks but their clothes.\n","Processing asent: I looked.\n","Processing asent: Unfortunately, Dan said, Roof O the World belongs to the great State of Colorado.\n","Processing asent: Ouch, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Hardly seems fair, since you just did Colorado and the rest of the world a favor.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Abra?\n","Processing asent: Back home.\n","Processing asent: Good.\n","Processing asent: And its over?\n","Processing asent: Really over?\n","Processing asent: Dan nodded.\n","Processing asent: Billy was staring at the ashes of Roses tophat.\n","Processing asent: Went up damn fast.\n","Processing asent: Almost like a special effect in a movie.\n","Processing asent: I imagine it was very old.\n","Processing asent: And full of magic, he didnt add.\n","Processing asent: The black variety.\n","Processing asent: Dan went to the pickup and sat behind the wheel so he could examine his face in the rearview mirror.\n","Processing asent: See anything that shouldnt be there?\n","Processing asent: Billy asked.\n","Processing asent: Thats what my mom always used to say when she caught me moonin over my own reflection.\n","Processing asent: Not a thing, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: A smile began to break on his face.\n","Processing asent: It was tired but genuine.\n","Processing asent: Not a thing in the world.\n","Processing asent: Then lets call the police and tell em about our accident, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: Ordinarily I got no use for the Five-O, but right about now I wouldnt mind some company.\n","Processing asent: Place gives me the willies.\n","Processing asent: He gave Dan a shrewd look.\n","Processing asent: Full of ghosts, aint it?\n","Processing asent: Thats why they picked it.\n","Processing asent: That was why, no doubt about it.\n","Processing asent: But you didnt need to be Ebenezer Scrooge to know there were good ghostie people as well as bad ones.\n","Processing asent: As they walked down toward the Overlook Lodge, Dan paused to look back at Roof O the World.\n","Processing asent: He was not entirely surprised to see a man standing on the platform by the broken rail.\n","Processing asent: He raised one hand, the summit of Pawnee Mountain visible through it, and sketched a flying kiss that Dan remembered from his childhood.\n","Processing asent: He remembered it well.\n","Processing asent: It had been their special end-of-the-day thing.\n","Processing asent: Bedtime, doc.\n","Processing asent: Sleep tight.\n","Processing asent: Dream up a dragon and tell me about it in the morning.\n","Processing asent: Dan knew he was going to cry, but not now.\n","Processing asent: This wasnt the time.\n","Processing asent: He lifted his own hand to his mouth and returned the kiss.\n","Processing asent: He looked for a moment longer at what remained of his father.\n","Processing asent: Then he headed down to the parking lot with Billy.\n","Processing asent: When they got there, he looked back once more.\n","Processing asent: Roof O the World was empty.\n","Processing asent: UNTIL YOU SLEEP\n","Processing asent: FEAR stands for face everything and recover.\n","Processing asent: Old AA saying\n","Processing asent: ANNIVERSARY\n","Processing asent: The Saturday noon AA meeting in Frazier was one of the oldest in New Hampshire, dating back to 1946, and had been founded by Fat Bob D., who had known the Programs founder, Bill Wilson, personally.\n","Processing asent: Fat Bob was long in his grave, a victim of lung cancerin the early days most recovering alkies had smoked like chimneys and newbies were routinely told to keep their mouths shut and the ashtrays emptybut the meeting was still well attended.\n","Processing asent: Today it was SRO, because when it was over there would be pizza and a sheet cake.\n","Processing asent: This was the case at most anniversary meetings, and today one of their number was celebrating fifteen years of sobriety.\n","Processing asent: In the early years he had been known as Dan or Dan T., but word of his work at the local hospice had gotten around (the AA magazine was not known as The Grapevine for nothing), and now he was most commonly called Doc.\n","Processing asent: Since his parents had called him that, Dan found the nickname ironic . . . but in a good way.\n","Processing asent: Life was a wheel, its only job was to turn, and it always came back to where it had started.\n","Processing asent: A real doctor, this one named John, chaired at Dans request, and the meeting followed its usual course.\n","Processing asent: There was laughter when Randy M. told how he had thrown up all over the cop who arrested him on his last DUI, and more when he went on to say he had discovered a year later that the cop himself was in the Program.\n","Processing asent: Maggie M. cried when she told (shared, in AA parlance) how she had again been denied joint custody of her two children.\n","Processing asent: The usual clichs were offeredtime takes time, it works if you work it, dont quit until the miracle happensand Maggie eventually quieted to sniffles.\n","Processing asent: There was the usual cry of Higher Power says turn it off! when a guys cell phone rang.\n","Processing asent: A gal with shaky hands spilled a cup of coffee; a meeting without at least one spilled cup of joe was rare indeed.\n","Processing asent: At ten to one, John D. passed the basket (We are self-supporting through our own contributions), and asked for announcements.\n","Processing asent: Trevor K., who opened the meeting, stood and askedas he always didfor help cleaning up the kitchen and putting away the chairs.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda V. did the Chip Club, giving out two whites (twenty-four hours) and a purple (five monthscommonly referred to as the Barney Chip).\n","Processing asent: As always, she ended by saying, If you havent had a drink today, give yourself and your Higher Power a hand.\n","Processing asent: When the applause died, John said, We have a fifteen-year anniversary today.\n","Processing asent: Will Casey K. and Dan T. come on up here?\n","Processing asent: The crowd applauded as Dan walked forwardslowly, to keep pace with Casey, who now walked with a cane.\n","Processing asent: John handed Casey the medallion with XV printed on its face, and Casey held it up so the crowd could see it.\n","Processing asent: I never thought this guy would make it, he said, because he was AA from the start.\n","Processing asent: By which I mean, an asshole with attitude.\n","Processing asent: They laughed dutifully at this oldie.\n","Processing asent: Dan smiled, but his heart was beating hard.\n","Processing asent: His one thought right now was to get through what came next without fainting.\n","Processing asent: The last time hed been this scared, he had been looking up at Rose the Hat on the Roof O the World platform and trying to keep from strangling himself with his own hands.\n","Processing asent: Hurry up, Casey.\n","Processing asent: Please.\n","Processing asent: Before I lose either my courage or my breakfast.\n","Processing asent: Casey might have been the one with the shining . . . or perhaps he saw something in Dans eyes.\n","Processing asent: In any case, he cut it short.\n","Processing asent: But he defied my expectations and got well.\n","Processing asent: For every seven alcoholics who walk through our doors, six walk back out again and get drunk.\n","Processing asent: The seventh is the miracle we all live for.\n","Processing asent: One of those miracles is standing right here, big as life and twice as ugly.\n","Processing asent: Here you go, Doc, you earned this.\n","Processing asent: He passed Dan the medallion.\n","Processing asent: For a moment Dan thought it would slip through his cold fingers and fall to the floor.\n","Processing asent: Casey folded his hand around it before it could, and then folded the rest of Dan into a massive hug.\n","Processing asent: In his ear he whispered, Another year, you sonofabitch.\n","Processing asent: Congratulations.\n","Processing asent: Casey stumped up the aisle to the back of the room, where he sat by right of seniority with the other oldtimers.\n","Processing asent: Dan was left alone at the front, clenching his fifteen-year medallion so hard the tendons stood out on his wrist.\n","Processing asent: The assembled alkies stared at him, waiting for what longtime sobriety was supposed to convey: experience, strength, and hope.\n","Processing asent: A couple of years ago . . . he began, and then had to clear his throat.\n","Processing asent: A couple of years ago, when I was having coffee with that gimpy-legged gentleman whos just now sitting down, he asked me if Id done the fifth step: Admitted to God, ourselves, and another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\n","Processing asent: I told him Id done most of it.\n","Processing asent: For folks who dont have our particular problem, that probably would have been enough . . . and thats just one of the reasons we call them Earth People.\n","Processing asent: They chuckled.\n","Processing asent: Dan drew a deep breath, telling himself if he could face Rose and her True Knot, he could face this.\n","Processing asent: Only this was different.\n","Processing asent: This wasnt Dan the Hero; it was Dan the Scumbag.\n","Processing asent: He had lived long enough to know there was a little scumbag in everyone, but it didnt help much when you had to take out the trash.\n","Processing asent: He told me that he thought there was one wrong I couldnt quite get past, because I was too ashamed to talk about it.\n","Processing asent: He told me to let it go.\n","Processing asent: He reminded me of something you hear at almost every meetingwere only as sick as our secrets.\n","Processing asent: And he said if I didnt tell mine, somewhere down the line Id find myself with a drink in my hand.\n","Processing asent: Was that the gist of it, Case?\n","Processing asent: From the back of the room Casey nodded, his hands folded over the top of his cane.\n","Processing asent: Dan felt the stinging at the back of his eyes that meant tears were on the way and thought, God help me to get through this without bawling.\n","Processing asent: Please.\n","Processing asent: I didnt spill it.\n","Processing asent: Id been telling myself for years it was the one thing Id never tell anyone.\n","Processing asent: But I think he was right, and if I start drinking again, Ill die.\n","Processing asent: I dont want to do that.\n","Processing asent: Ive got a lot to live for these days.\n","Processing asent: . . .\n","Processing asent: The tears had come, the goddam tears, but he was in too deep to back out now.\n","Processing asent: He wiped them away with the hand not fisted around the medallion.\n","Processing asent: You know what it says in the Promises?\n","Processing asent: About how well learn not to regret the past, or wish to shut the door on it?\n","Processing asent: Pardon me for saying so, but I think thats one item of bullshit in a program full of true things.\n","Processing asent: I regret plenty, but its time to open the door, little as I want to.\n","Processing asent: They waited.\n","Processing asent: Even the two ladies who had been doling out pizza slices on paper plates were now standing in the kitchen doorway and watching him.\n","Processing asent: Not too long before I quit drinking, I woke up next to some woman I picked up in a bar.\n","Processing asent: We were in her apartment.\n","Processing asent: The place was a dump, because she had almost nothing.\n","Processing asent: I could relate to that because I had almost nothing, and both of us were probably in Broke City for the same reason.\n","Processing asent: You all know what that reason is.\n","Processing asent: He shrugged.\n","Processing asent: If youre one of us, the bottle takes your shit, thats all.\n","Processing asent: First a little, then a lot, then everything.\n","Processing asent: This woman, her name was Deenie.\n","Processing asent: I dont remember much else about her, but I remember that.\n","Processing asent: I put on my clothes and left, but first I took her money.\n","Processing asent: And it turned out she had at least one thing I didnt, after all, because while I was going through her wallet, I looked around and her son was standing there.\n","Processing asent: Little kid still in diapers.\n","Processing asent: This woman and I had bought some coke the night before, and it was still on the table.\n","Processing asent: He saw it and reached for it.\n","Processing asent: He thought it was candy.\n","Processing asent: Dan wiped his eyes again.\n","Processing asent: I took it away and put it where he couldnt get it.\n","Processing asent: That much I did.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt enough, but that much I did.\n","Processing asent: Then I put her money in my pocket and walked out of there.\n","Processing asent: Id do anything to take that back.\n","Processing asent: But I cant.\n","Processing asent: The women in the doorway had gone back to the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: Some people were looking at their watches.\n","Processing asent: A stomach grumbled.\n","Processing asent: Looking at the assembled nine dozen alkies, Dan realized an astounding thing: what hed done didnt revolt them.\n","Processing asent: It didnt even surprise them.\n","Processing asent: They had heard worse.\n","Processing asent: Some had done worse.\n","Processing asent: Okay, he said.\n","Processing asent: Thats it.\n","Processing asent: Thanks for listening.\n","Processing asent: Before the applause, one of the oldtimers in the back row shouted out the traditional question: Howd you do it, Doc?\n","Processing asent: Dan smiled and gave the traditional answer.\n","Processing asent: One day at a time.\n","Processing asent: After the Our Father, and the pizza, and the chocolate cake with the big number XV on it, Dan helped Casey back to his Tundra.\n","Processing asent: A sleety rain had begun to fall.\n","Processing asent: Spring in New Hampshire, Casey said sourly.\n","Processing asent: Aint it wonderful.\n","Processing asent: Raineth drop and staineth slop, Dan said in a declamatory voice, and how the wind doth ram!\n","Processing asent: Skiddeth bus and sloppest us, damn you, sing goddam.\n","Processing asent: Casey stared at him.\n","Processing asent: Did you just make that up?\n","Processing asent: Nah.\n","Processing asent: Ezra Pound.\n","Processing asent: When are you going to quit dicking around and get that hip replaced?\n","Processing asent: Casey grinned.\n","Processing asent: Next month.\n","Processing asent: I decided that if you can tell your biggest secret, I can get my hip replaced.\n","Processing asent: He paused.\n","Processing asent: Not that your secret was all that fucking big, Danno.\n","Processing asent: So I discovered.\n","Processing asent: I thought theyd run from me, screaming.\n","Processing asent: Instead, they stood around eating pizza and talking about the weather.\n","Processing asent: If youd told em you killed a blind gramma, theyd have stayed to eat the pizza and cake.\n","Processing asent: Free is free.\n","Processing asent: He opened the drivers door.\n","Processing asent: Boost me, Danno.\n","Processing asent: Dan boosted him.\n","Processing asent: Casey wriggled ponderously, getting comfortable, then keyed the engine and got the wipers to work on the sleet.\n","Processing asent: Everythings smaller when its out, he said.\n","Processing asent: I hope youll pass that on to your pigeons.\n","Processing asent: Yes, O Wise One.\n","Processing asent: Casey looked at him sadly.\n","Processing asent: Go fuck yourself, sweetheart.\n","Processing asent: Actually, Danny said, I think Ill go back in and help put away the chairs.\n","Processing asent: And that was what he did.\n","Processing asent: UNTIL YOU SLEEP\n","Processing asent: No balloons or magician at Abra Stones birthday party this year.\n","Processing asent: She was fifteen.\n","Processing asent: There was neighborhood-rattling rock music slamming through the outdoor speakers Dave Stoneably assisted by Billy Freemanhad set up.\n","Processing asent: The adults had cake, ice cream, and coffee in the Stone kitchen.\n","Processing asent: The kids took over the downstairs family room and the back lawn, and from the sound of them, they had a blast.\n","Processing asent: They started to leave around five oclock, but Emma Deane, Abras closest friend, stayed for supper.\n","Processing asent: Abra, resplendent in a red skirt and off-the-shoulder peasant blouse, bubbled with good cheer.\n","Processing asent: She exclaimed over the charm bracelet Dan gave her, hugged him, kissed him on the cheek.\n","Processing asent: He smelled perfume.\n","Processing asent: That was new.\n","Processing asent: When Abra left to accompany Emma back to her house, the two of them chattering their way happily down the walk, Lucy leaned toward Dan.\n","Processing asent: Her mouth was pursed, there were new lines around her eyes, and her hair was showing the first touches of gray.\n","Processing asent: Abra seemed to have put the True Knot behind her; Dan thought Lucy never would.\n","Processing asent: Will you talk to her?\n","Processing asent: About the plates?\n","Processing asent: Im going outside to watch the sun go down over the river.\n","Processing asent: Maybe youll send her to visit with me a little when she gets back from the Deanes.\n","Processing asent: Lucy looked relieved, and Dan thought David did, as well.\n","Processing asent: To them she would always be a mystery.\n","Processing asent: Would it help to tell them she would always be one to him?\n","Processing asent: Probably not.\n","Processing asent: Good luck, chief, Billy said.\n","Processing asent: On the back stoop where Abra had once lain in a state that wasnt unconsciousness, John Dalton joined him.\n","Processing asent: Id offer to give you moral support, but I think you have to do this alone.\n","Processing asent: Have you tried talking to her?\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: At Lucys request.\n","Processing asent: John shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Shes pretty closed up on the subject.\n","Processing asent: I was, too, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: At her age.\n","Processing asent: But you never broke every plate in your mothers antique breakfront, did you?\n","Processing asent: My mother didnt have a breakfront, Dan said.\n","Processing asent: He walked down to the bottom of the Stones sloping backyard and regarded the Saco, which had, courtesy of the declining sun, become a glowing scarlet snake.\n","Processing asent: Soon the mountains would eat the last of the sunlight and the river would turn gray.\n","Processing asent: Where there had once been a chainlink fence to block the potentially disastrous explorations of young children, there was now a line of decorative bushes.\n","Processing asent: David had taken the fence down the previous October, saying Abra and her friends no longer needed its protection; they could all swim like fish.\n","Processing asent: But of course there were other dangers.\n","Processing asent: The color on the water had faded to the faintest pink tingeashes of roseswhen Abra joined him.\n","Processing asent: He didnt have to look around to know she was there, or to know she had put on a sweater to cover her bare shoulders.\n","Processing asent: The air cooled quickly on spring evenings in central New Hampshire even after the last threat of snow was gone.\n","Processing asent: (I love my bracelet Dan)\n","Processing asent: She had pretty much dropped the uncle part.\n","Processing asent: They want you to talk to me about the plates, she said.\n","Processing asent: The spoken words had none of the warmth that had come through in her thoughts, and the thoughts were gone.\n","Processing asent: After the very pretty and sincere thank-you, she had closed her inner self off to him.\n","Processing asent: She was good at that now, and getting better every day.\n","Processing asent: Dont they?\n","Processing asent: Do you want to talk about them?\n","Processing asent: I told her I was sorry.\n","Processing asent: I told her I didnt mean to.\n","Processing asent: I dont think she believed me.\n","Processing asent: Because you know.\n","Processing asent: They dont.\n","Processing asent: Dan said nothing, and passed on only a single thought:\n","Processing asent: They dont believe me about anything! she burst out.\n","Processing asent: Its so unfair!\n","Processing asent: I didnt know there was going to be booze at Jennifers stupid party, and I didnt have any!\n","Processing asent: Still, she grounds me for two fucking weeks!\n","Processing asent: Nothing.\n","Processing asent: The river was almost entirely gray now.\n","Processing asent: He risked a look at her and saw she was studying her sneakersred to match her skirt.\n","Processing asent: Her cheeks now also matched her skirt.\n","Processing asent: All right, she said at last, and although she still didnt look at him, the corners of her lips turned up in a grudging little smile.\n","Processing asent: Cant fool you, can I?\n","Processing asent: I had one swallow, just to see what it tasted like.\n","Processing asent: What the big deal is.
