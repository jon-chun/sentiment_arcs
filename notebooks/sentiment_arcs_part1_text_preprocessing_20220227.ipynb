Virtually all long text contains narrative elements...(TODO: Insert excerpts from Paper Abstract/Intro Sections here)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **SentimentArcs: Cloning the Github repository to your gDrive**\n","\n","If this is the first time using SentimentArcs, you will need to copy the software from our Github.com repository (github repo). The default recommended gDrive path is ./gdrive/MyDrive/research/sentiment_arcs/'. \n","\n","The first time you run this notebook and connect your Google gDrive, it will allow to to specify the path to your SentimentArcs subdirectory. If it does not exists, this notebook will copy/clone the SentimentArcs github repository code to your gDrive at the path you specify.\n","\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **NovelText: A Reference Corpus of 24 Diverse Novel**\n","\n","Sentiment Arcs comes with a carefully curated reference corpus of Novels to illustrate the unique diachronic sentiment analysis characteristic of long form fictional narrativeas. This corpus of 24 diverse novels also provides a baseline for exploring and comparing new novels with sentiment analysis using SentimentArcs.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Preparing New Novels: Formatting and adding to subdirectory**\n","\n","To analyze new novels with SentimentArcs, the body of the text should consist of plain text organized in to blocks separated by two newlines which visually look like a single blank line between blocks. These blocks are usually paragraphs but can also include title headers, separate lines of dialog or quotes. Please reference any of the 24 novels in the NovelText corpus for examples of this expected format.\n","\n","Once the new novel is correctly formatted as a plain text file, it should follow this standard file naming convention:\n","\n","[first letter of first name]+[full lastname]_[abbreviated book title].txt\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","* fdouglass_narrativelifeofaslave\n","* fscottfitzgerald_thegreatgatsby.txt\n","* vwoolf_mrsdalloway.txt\n","* homer-ewilson_odyssey.txt (trans. E.Wilson)\n","* mproust-mtreharne_3guermantesway.txt (Book 3, trans. M.Treharne)\n","* staugustine_confessions9end.txt (Upto and incl Book 9)\n","\n","Note the optional author suffix (-translator) and optional title suffix (-selected chapters/books)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Adding New Novels: Add file to subdirectory and Update this Notebook**\n","\n","Once you have a cleaned and text file named according the standard rule above, you must move that file to the subdirectory of all input novels and update the global variable in this notebook that defines which novels to analyze.\n","\n","First, copy your cleaned text file to the subdirectory containing all novels read by this notebook. This subdir is defined by the program variable 'subdir_novels' with the default value './in1_novels/'\n","\n","Second, update the program variable 'novels_dt'. This is a Dictionary data structure that following the pattern below:\n","```\n","novels_dt = {\n","  'cdickens_achristmascarol':['A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ',1843,1399],\n","```\n","Where the first string (the dictionary key) must match the filename root without the '.txt' suffix (e.g. cdickens_achristmascarol). The Dictionary value after the ':' is a list of three elements:\n","\n","* A nicely formatted string of the form '(title) by (full first and last name of author)' that should be a human friendly string used to label plots and saved files.\n","\n","* The (publication year) and the (sentence count). Both are optional, but should have placeholder string '0' if unknown. These are intended for future reference and analytics.\n","\n","* Your future self will thank you if you insert new novels into the 'novels_dt' in alphabetic order for faster and more accurate reference.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **How to Execute SentimentArcs Notebooks:**\n","\n","This is a Jupyter Notebook created to run on Google's free Colab service using only a browers and your exiting Google email account. We chose Google Colab because it is relatively, fast, free, easy to use and makes collaboration as simple as web browsing.\n","\n","A few reminders about using Jupyter Notebooks general and SentimentArcs in particular:\n","\n","* All cells must be run ***in order*** as later code cells often depend upon the output of earlier code cells\n","\n","* ***Cells that take more time to execute*** (> 1 min) usually begin with *%%time* which outputs the *total execution time* of the last run.  This timing output is deleted and recalculated each time the code cell is executed.\n","\n","* **[OPTIONAL]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* change a setting in that cell to customize behavior.\n","\n","* **[CUSTOMIZE]** at the top of a cell indicates you *must* change a setting in that cell.\n","\n","* **[RESTART REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* see a *[RESTART REQUIRED] button* at the end of the output. *If you see this button, you must select [Runtime]->[Restart Runtime] from the top menubar.\n","\n","* **[INPUT REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you will be required to take some action for execution to proceed, usually by clicking a button or entering the response to a prompt.\n","\n","All cells with a top comment prefixed with # [OPTIONAL]: indicates that you can change a setting to customize behavior, the prefix [CUSTOMIZE] indicates you MUST set/change a setting\n","\n","* SentimentArcs divides workflow into a series of chronological Jupyter Notebooks that must be run in order. Here is an overview of the workflow:\n","\n","***\n","\n","**SentimentArcs Notebooks Workflow**\n","1. Notebook #1: Preprocess Text\n","2. Notebook #2: Compute Sentiment Values (Simple Models/CPUs)\n","3. Notebook #3: Compute Sentiment Values (Complex Models/GPUs)\n","4. Notebook #4: Combine all Sentiment Values, perform Time Series analysis, and extract Crux points and surrounding text\n","\n","If you are unfamilar with setting up and using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, here are a series of resources to quickly bring you up to speed. If you are using SentimentArcs with the Cambridge University Press Elements textbook, there are also a series of videos by Prof Elkins and Chun stepping you through these notebooks.\n","\n","***\n","\n","**Additional Resources and Tutorials**\n","\n","\n","**Google Colab and Jupyter Resources:**\n","\n","* Coming...\n","* [IPython, Python Data Science Handbook by Jake

output truncated to the last 5000 lines.\u001b[0m\n","Processing asent: No! no! no! she would not!\n","Processing asent: She clenched her fist.\n","Processing asent: She stamped.\n","Processing asent: And Mr. Bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship.\n","Processing asent: He must have dried and shrunk.\n","Processing asent: The Ramsays were not rich, and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all.\n","Processing asent: Eight children!\n","Processing asent: To feed eight children on philosophy!\n","Processing asent: Here was another of them, Jasper this time, strolling past, to have a shot at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging Lily's hand like a pump-handle as he passed, which caused Mr. Bankes to say, bitterly, how SHE was a favourite.\n","Processing asent: There was education now to be considered (true, Mrs. Ramsay had something of her own perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those \"great fellows,\" all well grown, angular, ruthless youngsters, must require.\n","Processing asent: As for being sure which was which, or in what order they came, that was beyond him.\n","Processing asent: He called them privately after the Kings and Queens of England; Cam the Wicked, James the Ruthless, Andrew the Just, Prue the Fairfor Prue would have beauty, he thought, how could she help it?and Andrew brains.\n","Processing asent: While he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed Ramsay's case, commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities.\n","Processing asent: They gave him somethingWilliam Bankes acknowledged that; it would have been pleasant if Cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder, as over her father's, to look at a picture of Vesuvius in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not but feel, destroyed something.\n","Processing asent: What would a stranger think now?\n","Processing asent: What did this Lily Briscoe think?\n","Processing asent: Could one help noticing that habits grew on him?\n","Processing asent: eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps?\n","Processing asent: It was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he didbut that was too harsh a phrasecould depend so much as he did upon people's praise.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, but,\" said Lily, \"think of his work!\"\n","Processing asent: Whenever she \"thought of his work\" she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table.\n","Processing asent: It was Andrew's doing.\n","Processing asent: She asked him what his father's books were about.\n","Processing asent: \"Subject and object and the nature of reality,\" Andrew had said.\n","Processing asent: And when she said Heavens, she had no notion what that meant.\n","Processing asent: \"Think of a kitchen table then,\" he told her, \"when you're not there.\"\n","Processing asent: So now she always saw, when she thought of Mr. Ramsay's work, a scrubbed kitchen table.\n","Processing asent: It lodged now in the fork of a pear tree, for they had reached the orchard.\n","Processing asent: And with a painful effort of concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its fish-shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table, one of those scrubbed board tables, grained and knotted, whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four legs in air.\n","Processing asent: Naturally, if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table (and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so), naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes liked her for bidding him \"think of his work.\"\n","Processing asent: He had thought of it, often and often.\n","Processing asent: Times without number, he had said, \"Ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty.\"\n","Processing asent: He had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only five and twenty; what came after was more or less amplification, repetition.\n","Processing asent: But the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small, he said, pausing by the pear tree, well brushed, scrupulously exact, exquisitely judicial.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly, as if the movement of his hand had released it, the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him.\n","Processing asent: That was one sensation.\n","Processing asent: Then up rose in a fume the essence of his being.\n","Processing asent: That was another.\n","Processing asent: She felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception; it was his severity; his goodness.\n","Processing asent: I respect you (she addressed silently him in person) in every atom; you are not vain; you are entirely impersonal; you are finer than Mr. Ramsay; you are the finest human being that I know; you have neither wife nor child (without any sexual feeling, she longed to cherish that loneliness), you live for science (involuntarily, sections of potatoes rose before her eyes); praise would be an insult to you; generous, pure-hearted, heroic man!\n","Processing asent: But simultaneously, she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here; objected to dogs on chairs; would prose for hours (until Mr. Ramsay slammed out of the room) about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of English cooks.\n","Processing asent: How then did it work out, all this?\n","Processing asent: How did one judge people, think of them?\n","Processing asent: How did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking?\n","Processing asent: And to those words, what meaning attached, after all?\n","Processing asent: Standing now, apparently transfixed, by the pear tree, impressions poured in upon her of those two men, and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one's pencil, and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable, everlasting, contradictory things, so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity.\n","Processing asent: You have greatness, she continued, but Mr. Ramsay has none of it.\n","Processing asent: He is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is spoilt; he is a tyrant; he wears Mrs. Ramsay to death; but he has what you (she addressed Mr. Bankes) have not; a fiery unworldliness; he knows nothing about trifles; he loves dogs and his children.\n","Processing asent: He has eight.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes has none.\n","Processing asent: Did he not come down in two coats the other night and let Mrs. Ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin?\n","Processing asent: All of this danced up and down, like a company of gnats, each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic netdanced up and down in Lily's mind, in and about the branches of the pear tree, where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table, symbol of her profound respect for Mr. Ramsay's mind, until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity; she felt released; a shot went off close at hand, and there came, flying from its fragments, frightened, effusive, tumultuous, a flock of starlings.\n","Processing asent: \"Jasper!\" said Mr. Bankes.\n","Processing asent: They turned the way the starlings flew, over the terrace.\n","Processing asent: Following the scatter of swift-flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into Mr. Ramsay, who boomed tragically at them, \"Some one had blundered!\"\n","Processing asent: His eyes, glazed with emotion, defiant with tragic intensity, met theirs for a second, and trembled on the verge of recognition; but then, raising his hand, half-way to his face as if to avert, to brush off, in an agony of peevish shame, their normal gaze, as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable, as if he impressed upon them his own child-like resentment of interruption, yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed, but in which he revelledhe turned abruptly, slammed his private door on them; and, Lily Briscoe and Mr. Bankes, looking uneasily up into the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which Jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees.\n","Processing asent: \"And even if it isn't fine tomorrow,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, raising her eyes to glance at William Bankes and Lily Briscoe as they passed, \"it will be another day. And now,\" she said, thinking that Lily's charm was her Chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered little face, but it would take a clever man to see it, \"and now stand up, and let me measure your leg,\" for they might go to the Lighthouse after all, and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg.\n","Processing asent: Smiling, for it was an admirable idea, that had flashed upon her this very secondWilliam and Lily should marryshe took the heather-mixture stocking, with its criss-cross of steel needles at the mouth of it, and measured it against James's leg.\n","Processing asent: \"My dear, stand still,\" she said, for in his jealousy, not liking to serve as measuring block for the Lighthouse keeper's little boy, James fidgeted purposely; and if he did that, how could she see, was it too long, was it too short?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: She looked upwhat demon possessed him, her youngest, her cherished?and saw the room, saw the chairs, thought them fearfully shabby.\n","Processing asent: Their entrails, as Andrew said the other day, were all over the floor; but then what was the point, she asked, of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house, with only one old woman to see to it, positively dripped with wet?\n","Processing asent: Never mind, the rent was precisely twopence half-penny; the children loved it; it did her husband good to be three thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room for visitors.\n","Processing asent: Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose London life of service was donethey did well enough here; and a photograph or two, and books.\n","Processing asent: Books, she thought, grew of themselves.\n","Processing asent: She never had time to read them.\n","Processing asent: Alas! even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself: \"For her whose wishes must be obeyed\"...\"The happier Helen of our days\"...disgraceful to say, she had never read them.\n","Processing asent: And Croom on the Mind and Bates on the Savage Customs of Polynesia (\"My dear, stand still,\" she said)neither of those could one send to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: At a certain moment, she supposed, the house would become so shabby that something must be done.\n","Processing asent: If they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with themthat would be something.\n","Processing asent: Crabs, she had to allow, if Andrew really wished to dissect them, or if Jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed, one could not prevent it; or Rose's objectsshells, reeds, stones; for they were gifted, her children, but all in quite different ways.\n","Processing asent: And the result of it was, she sighed, taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling, as she held the stocking against James's leg, that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer.\n","Processing asent: The mat was fading; the wall-paper was flapping.\n","Processing asent: You couldn't tell any more that those were roses on it.\n","Processing asent: Still, if every door in a house is left perpetually open, and no lockmaker in the whole of Scotland can mend a bolt, things must spoil.\n","Processing asent: What was the use of flinging a green Cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame?\n","Processing asent: In two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup.\n","Processing asent: But it was the doors that annoyed her; every door was left open.\n","Processing asent: She listened.\n","Processing asent: The drawing-room door was open; the hall door was open; it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open; and certainly the window on the landing was open, for that she had opened herself.\n","Processing asent: That windows should be open, and doors shutsimple as it was, could none of them remember it?\n","Processing asent: She would go into the maids' bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens, except for Marie's, the Swiss girl, who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air, but then at home, she had said, \"the mountains are so beautiful.\"\n","Processing asent: She had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes.\n","Processing asent: \"The mountains are so beautiful.\"\n","Processing asent: Her father was dying there, Mrs. Ramsay knew.\n","Processing asent: He was leaving them fatherless.\n","Processing asent: Scolding and demonstrating (how to make a bed, how to open a window, with hands that shut and spread like a Frenchwoman's) all had folded itself quietly about her, when the girl spoke, as, after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple.\n","Processing asent: She had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said.\n","Processing asent: He had cancer of the throat.\n","Processing asent: At the recolectionhow she had stood there, how the girl had said, \"At home the mountains are so beautiful,\" and there was no hope, no hope whatever, she had a spasm of irritation, and speaking sharply, said to James:\n","Processing asent: \"Stand still. Don't be tiresome,\" so that he knew instantly that her severity was real, and straightened his leg and she measured it.\n","Processing asent: The stocking was too short by half an inch at least, making allowance for the fact that Sorley's little boy would be less well grown than James.\n","Processing asent: \"It's too short,\" she said, \"ever so much too short.\"\n","Processing asent: Never did anybody look so sad.\n","Processing asent: Bitter and black, half-way down, in the darkness, in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths, perhaps a tear formed; a tear fell; the waters swayed this way and that, received it, and were at rest.\n","Processing asent: Never did anybody look so sad.\n","Processing asent: But was it nothing but looks, people said?\n","Processing asent: What was there behind ither beauty and splendour?\n","Processing asent: Had he blown his brains out, they asked, had he died the week before they were marriedsome other, earlier lover, of whom rumours reached one?\n","Processing asent: Or was there nothing?\n","Processing asent: nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind, and could do nothing to disturb?\n","Processing asent: For easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion, of love foiled, of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself, she never spoke.\n","Processing asent: She was silent always.\n","Processing asent: She knew thenshe knew without having learnt.\n","Processing asent: Her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified.\n","Processing asent: Her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone, alight exact as a bird, gave her, naturally, this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted, eased, sustainedfalsely perhaps.\n","Processing asent: (\"Nature has but little clay,\" said Mr. Bankes once, much moved by her voice on the telephone, though she was only telling him a fact about a train, \"like that of which she moulded you.\"\n","Processing asent: He saw her at the end of the line, Greek, blue-eyed, straight-nosed.\n","Processing asent: How incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that.\n","Processing asent: The Graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face.\n","Processing asent: Yes, he would catch the 10:30 at Euston.\n","Processing asent: \"But she's no more aware of her beauty than a child,\" said Mr. Bankes, replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house.\n","Processing asent: And he thought of Mrs. Ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls.\n","Processing asent: For always, he thought, there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face.\n","Processing asent: She clapped a deer-stalker's hat on her head; she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief.\n","Processing asent: So that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of, one must remember the quivering thing, the living thing (they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them), and work it into the picture; or if one thought of her simply as a woman, one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasyshe did not like admirationor suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty, and she wanted only to be like other people, insignificant.\n","Processing asent: He did not know.\n","Processing asent: He did not know.\n","Processing asent: He must go to his work.\n","Processing asent: Knitting her reddish-brown hairy stocking, with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame, the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame, and the authenticated masterpiece by Michael Angelo, Mrs. Ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before, raised his head, and kissed her little boy on the forehead.\n","Processing asent: \"Let us find another picture to cut out,\" she said.\n","Processing asent: But what had happened?\n","Processing asent: Some one had blundered.\n","Processing asent: Starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time.\n","Processing asent: \"Some one had blundered\"Fixing her short-sighted eyes upon her husband, who was now bearing down upon her, she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her (the jingle mated itself in her head) that something had happened, some one had blundered.\n","Processing asent: But she could not for the life of her think what.\n","Processing asent: He shivered; he quivered.\n","Processing asent: All his vanity, all his satisfaction in his own splendour, riding fell as a thunderbolt, fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death, had been shattered, destroyed.\n","Processing asent: Stormed at by shot and shell, boldly we rode and well, flashed through the valley of death, volleyed and thunderedstraight into Lily Briscoe and William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: He quivered; he shivered.\n","Processing asent: Not for the world would she have spoken to him, realising, from the familiar signs, his eyes averted, and some curious gathering together of his person, as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium, that he was outraged and anguished.\n","Processing asent: She stroked James's head; she transferred to him what she felt for her husband, and, as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the Army and Navy Stores catalogue, thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist; and why should he not?\n","Processing asent: He had a splendid forehead.\n","Processing asent: Then, looking up, as her husband passed her once more, she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled; domesticity triumphed; custom crooned its soothing rhythm, so that when stopping deliberately, as his turn came round again, at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle James's bare calf with a sprig of something, she twitted him for having dispatched \"that poor young man,\" Charles Tansley.\n","Processing asent: Tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation, he said.\n","Processing asent: \"James will have to write HIS dissertation one of these days,\" he added ironically, flicking his sprig.\n","Processing asent: Hating his father, James brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him, compound of severity and humour, he teased his youngest son's bare leg.\n","Processing asent: She was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to Sorley's little boy tomorrow, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: There wasn't the slightest possible chance that they could go to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mr. Ramsay snapped out irascibly.\n","Processing asent: How did he know?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: The wind often changed.\n","Processing asent: The extraordinary irrationality of her remark, the folly of women's minds enraged him.\n","Processing asent: He had ridden through the valley of death, been shattered and shivered; and now, she flew in the face of facts, made his children hope what was utterly out of the question, in effect, told lies.\n","Processing asent: He stamped his foot on the stone step.\n","Processing asent: \"Damn you,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: But what had she said?\n","Processing asent: Simply that it might be fine tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: So it might.\n","Processing asent: Not with the barometer falling and the wind due west.\n","Processing asent: To pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings, to rendthe thin veils of civilization so wantonly, so brutally, was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that, without replying, dazed and blinded, she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail, the drench of dirty water, bespatter her unrebuked.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing to be said.\n","Processing asent: He stood by her in silence.\n","Processing asent: Very humbly, at length, he said that he would step over and ask the Coastguards if she liked.\n","Processing asent: There was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him.\n","Processing asent: She was quite ready to take his word for it, she said.\n","Processing asent: Only then they need not cut sandwichesthat was all.\n","Processing asent: They came to her, naturally, since she was a woman, all day long with this and that; one wanting this, another that; the children were growing up; she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions.\n","Processing asent: Then he said, Damn you.\n","Processing asent: He said, It must rain.\n","Processing asent: He said, It won't rain; and instantly a Heaven of security opened before her.\n","Processing asent: There was nobody she reverenced more.\n","Processing asent: She was not good enough to tie his shoe strings, she felt.\n","Processing asent: Already ashamed of that petulance, of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops, Mr. Ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son's bare legs once more, and then, as if he had her leave for it, with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the Zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side, he dived into the evening air which, already thinner, was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but, as if in return, restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day.\n","Processing asent: \"Some one had blundered,\" he said again, striding off, up and down the terrace.\n","Processing asent: But how extraordinarily his note had changed!\n","Processing asent: It was like the cuckoo; \"in June he gets out of tune\"; as if he were trying over, tentatively seeking, some phrase for a new mood, and having only this at hand, used it, cracked though it was.\n","Processing asent: But it sounded ridiculous\"Some one had blundered\"said like that, almost as a question, without any conviction, melodiously.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay could not help smiling, and soon, sure enough, walking up and down, he hummed it, dropped it, fell silent.\n","Processing asent: He was safe, he was restored to his privacy.\n","Processing asent: He stopped to light his pipe, looked once at his wife and son in the window, and as one raises one's eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm, a tree, a cluster of cottages as an illustration, a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns, fortified, and satisfied, so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife, the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind.\n","Processing asent: It was a splendid mind.\n","Processing asent: For if thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q. Here, stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums, he saw, but now far, far away, like children picking up shells, divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived, his wife and son, together, in the window.\n","Processing asent: They needed his protection; he gave it them.\n","Processing asent: But after Q?\n","Processing asent: What comes next?\n","Processing asent: After Q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes, but glimmers red in the distance.\n","Processing asent: Z is only reached once by one man in a generation.\n","Processing asent: Still, if he could reach R it would be something.\n","Processing asent: Here at least was Q. He dug his heels in at Q. Q he was sure of.\n","Processing asent: Q he could demonstrate.\n","Processing asent: If Q then is QR.\n","Processing asent: Here he knocked his pipe out, with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn, and proceeded.\n","Processing asent: \"Then R...\"\n","Processing asent: He braced himself.\n","Processing asent: He clenched himself.\n","Processing asent: Qualities that would have saved a ship's company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of waterendurance and justice, foresight, devotion, skill, came to his help.\n","Processing asent: R is thenwhat is R?\n","Processing asent: A shutter, like the leathern eyelid of a lizard, flickered over the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter R. In that flash of darkness he heard people sayinghe was a failurethat R was beyond him.\n","Processing asent: He would never reach R. On to R, once more.\n","Processing asent: Qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes of the Polar region would have made him the leader, the guide, the counsellor, whose temper, neither sanguine nor despondent, surveys with equanimity what is to be and faces it, came to his help again.\n","Processing asent: The lizard's eye flickered once more.\n","Processing asent: The veins on his forehead bulged.\n","Processing asent: The geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and, displayed among its leaves, he could see, without wishing it, that old, that obvious distinction between the two classes of men; on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who, plodding and persevering, repeat the whole alphabet in order, twenty-six letters in all, from start to finish; on the other the gifted, the inspired who, miraculously, lump all the letters together in one flashthe way of genius.\n","Processing asent: He had not genius; he laid no claim to that: but he had, or might have had, the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from A to Z accurately in order.\n","Processing asent: Meanwhile, he stuck at Q. On, then, on to R.\n","Processing asent: Feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who, now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist, knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes, stole upon him, paling the colour of his eyes, giving him, even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace, the bleached look of withered old age.\n","Processing asent: Yet he would not die lying down; he would find some crag of rock, and there, his eyes fixed on the storm, trying to the end to pierce the darkness, he would die standing.\n","Processing asent: He would never reach R.\n","Processing asent: He stood stock-still, by the urn, with the geranium flowing over it.\n","Processing asent: How many men in a thousand million, he asked himself, reach Z after all?\n","Processing asent: Surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that, and answer, without treachery to the expedition behind him, \"One perhaps.\"\n","Processing asent: One in a generation.\n","Processing asent: Is he to be blamed then if he is not that one?\n","Processing asent: provided he has toiled honestly, given to the best of his power, and till he has no more left to give?\n","Processing asent: And his fame lasts how long?\n","Processing asent: It is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter.\n","Processing asent: His fame lasts perhaps two thousand years.\n","Processing asent: And what are two thousand years?\n","Processing asent: (asked Mr. Ramsay ironically, staring at the hedge).\n","Processing asent: What, indeed, if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages?\n","Processing asent: The very stone one kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare.\n","Processing asent: His own little light would shine, not very brightly, for a year or two, and would then be merged in some bigger light, and that in a bigger still.\n","Processing asent: (He looked into the hedge, into the intricacy of the twigs.)\n","Processing asent: Who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars, if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow, and square his shoulders, so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post, the fine figure of a soldier?\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very upright by the urn.\n","Processing asent: Who shall blame him, if, so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame, upon search parties, upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones?\n","Processing asent: Finally, who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition, if, having adventured to the uttermost, and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not, he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives, and does not on the whole object to live, but requires sympathy, and whisky, and some one to tell the story of his suffering to at once?\n","Processing asent: Who shall blame him?\n","Processing asent: Who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off, and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son, who, very distant at first, gradually come closer and closer, till lips and book and head are clearly before him, though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars, and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before herwho will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world?\n","Processing asent: But his son hated him.\n","Processing asent: He hated him for coming up to them, for stopping and looking down on them; he hated him for interrupting them; he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures; for the magnificence of his head; for his exactingness and egotism (for there he stood, commanding them to attend to him) but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father's emotion which, vibrating round them, disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother.\n","Processing asent: By looking fixedly at the page, he hoped to make him move on; by pointing his finger at a word, he hoped to recall his mother's attention, which, he knew angrily, wavered instantly his father stopped.\n","Processing asent: But, no.\n","Processing asent: Nothing would make Mr. Ramsay move on.\n","Processing asent: There he stood, demanding sympathy.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay, who had been sitting loosely, folding her son in her arm, braced herself, and, half turning, seemed to raise herself with an effort, and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy, a column of spray, looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force, burning and illuminating (quietly though she sat, taking up her stocking again), and into this delicious fecundity, this fountain and spray of life, the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself, like a beak of brass, barren and bare.\n","Processing asent: He wanted sympathy.\n","Processing asent: He was a failure, he said.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay flashed her needles.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay repeated, never taking his eyes from her face, that he was a failure.\n","Processing asent: She blew the words back at him.\n","Processing asent: \"Charles Tansley...\" she said.\n","Processing asent: But he must have more than that.\n","Processing asent: It was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his genius, first of all, and then to be taken within the circle of life, warmed and soothed, to have his senses restored to him, his barrenness made furtile, and all the rooms of the house made full of lifethe drawing-room; behind the drawing-room the kitchen; above the kitchen the bedrooms; and beyond them the nurseries; they must be furnished, they must be filled with life.\n","Processing asent: Charles Tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time, she said.\n","Processing asent: But he must have more than that.\n","Processing asent: He must have sympathy.\n","Processing asent: He must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life; was needed; not only here, but all over the world.\n","Processing asent: Flashing her needles, confident, upright, she created drawing-room and kitchen, set them all aglow; bade him take his ease there, go in and out, enjoy himself.\n","Processing asent: She laughed, she knitted.\n","Processing asent: Standing between her knees, very stiff, James felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of the male, which smote mercilessly, again and again, demanding sympathy.\n","Processing asent: He was a failure, he repeated.\n","Processing asent: Well, look then, feel then.\n","Processing asent: Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window, into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence (as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child), that it was real; the house was full; the garden blowing.\n","Processing asent: If he put implicit faith in her, nothing should hurt him; however deep he buried himself or climed high, not for a second should he find himself without her.\n","Processing asent: So boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent; and James, as he stood stiff between her knees, felt her rise in a rosy-flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of his father, the egotistical man, plunged and smote, demanding sympathy.\n","Processing asent: Filled with her words, like a child who drops off satisfied, he said, at last, looking at her with humble gratitude, restored, renewed, that he would take a turn; he would watch the children playing cricket.\n","Processing asent: He went.\n","Processing asent: Immediately, Mrs. Ramsey seemed to fold herself together, one petal closed in another, and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself, so that she had only strength enough to move her finger, in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion, across the page of Grimm's fairy story, while there throbbed through her, like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat, the rapture of successful creation.\n","Processing asent: Every throb of this pulse seemed, as he walked away, to enclose her and her husband, and to give to each that solace which two different notes, one high, one low, struck together, seem to give each other as they combine.\n","Processing asent: Yet as the resonance died, and she turned to the Fairy Tale again, Mrs. Ramsey felt not only exhausted in body (afterwards, not at the time, she always felt this) but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin.\n","Processing asent: Not that, as she read aloud the story of the Fisherman's Wife, she knew precisely what it came from; nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized, at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully, ominously, a wave fall, how it came from this: she did not like, even for a second, to feel finer than her husband; and further, could not bear not being entirely sure, when she spoke to him, of the truth of what she said.\n","Processing asent: Universities and people wanting him, lectures and books and their being of the highest importanceall that she did not doubt for a moment; but it was their relation, and his coming to her like that, openly, so that any one could see, that discomposed her; for then people said he depended on her, when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important, and what she gave the world, in comparison with what he gave, negligable.\n","Processing asent: But then again, it was the other thing toonot being able to tell him the truth, being afraid, for instance, about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be, fifty pounds perhaps to mend it; and then about his books, to be afraid that he might guess, what she a little suspected, that his last book was not quite his best book (she gathered that from William Bankes); and then to hide small daily things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on themall this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two notes sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness.\n","Processing asent: A shadow was on the page; she looked up.\n","Processing asent: It was Augustus Carmichael shuffling past, precisely now, at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships, that the most perfect was flawed, and could not bear the examination which, loving her husband, with her instinct for truth, she turned upon it; when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness, and impeded in her proper function by these lies, these exaggerations,it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation, that Mr. Carmichael shuffled past, in his yellow slippers, and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out, as he passed,\n","Processing asent: \"Going indoors Mr. Carmichael?\"\n","Processing asent: He said nothing.\n","Processing asent: He took opium.\n","Processing asent: The children said he had stained his beard yellow with it.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps.\n","Processing asent: What was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy, came to them every year as an escape; and yet every year she felt the same thing; he did not trust her.\n","Processing asent: She said, \"I am going to the town. Shall I get you stamps, paper, tobacco?\" and she felt him wince.\n","Processing asent: He did not trust her.\n","Processing asent: It was his wife's doing.\n","Processing asent: She remembered that iniquity of his wife's towards him, which had made her turn to steel and adamant there, in the horrible little room in St John's Wood, when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house.\n","Processing asent: He was unkempt; he dropped things on his coat; he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do; and she turned him out of the room.\n","Processing asent: She said, in her odious way, \"Now, Mrs. Ramsay and I want to have a little talk together,\" and Mrs. Ramsay could see, as if before her eyes, the innumerable miseries of his life.\n","Processing asent: Had he money enough to buy tobacco?\n","Processing asent: Did he have to ask her for it?\n","Processing asent: half a crown?\n","Processing asent: eighteenpence?\n","Processing asent: Oh, she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer.\n","Processing asent: And always now (why, she could not guess, except that it came probably from that woman somehow) he shrank from her.\n","Processing asent: He never told her anything.\n","Processing asent: But what more could she have done?\n","Processing asent: There was a sunny room given up to him.\n","Processing asent: The children were good to him.\n","Processing asent: Never did she show a sign of not wanting him.\n","Processing asent: She went out of her way indeed to be friendly.\n","Processing asent: Do you want stamps, do you want tobacco?\n","Processing asent: Here's a book you might like and so on.\n","Processing asent: And after allafter all (here insensibly she drew herself together, physically, the sense of her own beauty becoming, as it did so seldom, present to her) after all, she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her; for instance, George Manning; Mr. Wallace; famous as they were, they would come to her of an evening, quietly, and talk alone over her fire.\n","Processing asent: She bore about with her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all, veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent.\n","Processing asent: She had been admired.\n","Processing asent: She had been loved.\n","Processing asent: She had entered rooms where mourners sat.\n","Processing asent: Tears had flown in her presence.\n","Processing asent: Men, and women too, letting go to the multiplicity of things, had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity.\n","Processing asent: It injured her that he should shrink.\n","Processing asent: It hurt her.\n","Processing asent: And yet not cleanly, not rightly.\n","Processing asent: That was what she minded, coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband; the sense she had now when Mr. Carmichael shuffled past, just nodding to her question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow slippers, that she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to give, to help, was vanity.\n","Processing asent: For her own self-satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of her, \"O Mrs. Ramsay! dear Mrs. Ramsay...Mrs. Ramsay, of course!\" and need her and send for her and admire her?\n","Processing asent: Was it not secretly this that she wanted, and therefore when Mr. Carmichael shrank away from her, as he did at this moment, making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly, she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct, but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her, and of human relations, how flawed they are, how despicable, how self-seeking, at their best.\n","Processing asent: Shabby and worn out, and not presumably (her cheeks were hollow, her hair was white) any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy, she had better devote her mind to the story of the Fisherman and his Wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness (none of her children was as sensitive as he was), her son James.\n","Processing asent: \"The man's heart grew heavy,\" she read aloud, \"and he would not go. He said to himself, 'It is not right,' and yet he went. And when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue, and grey and thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was still quiet. And he stood there and said\"\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop.\n","Processing asent: Why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket?\n","Processing asent: But he did not speak; he looked; he nodded; he approved; he went on.\n","Processing asent: He slipped, seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause, signified some conclusion, seeing his wife and child, seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought, and bore, written up among their leaves, as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of readinghe slipped, seeing all this, smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in THE TIMES about the number of Americans who visit Shakespeare's house every year.\n","Processing asent: If Shakespeare had never existed, he asked, would the world have differed much from what it is today?\n","Processing asent: Does the progress of civilization depend upon great men?\n","Processing asent: Is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the Pharaohs?\n","Processing asent: Is the lot of the average human being, however, he asked himself, the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization?\n","Processing asent: Possibly not.\n","Processing asent: Possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class.\n","Processing asent: The liftman in the Tube is an eternal necessity.\n","Processing asent: The thought was distasteful to him.\n","Processing asent: He tossed his head.\n","Processing asent: To avoid it, he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts.\n","Processing asent: He would argue that the world exists for the average human being; that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life; they do not express it.\n","Processing asent: Nor is Shakespeare necessary to it.\n","Processing asent: Not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage Shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift, he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge.\n","Processing asent: All this would have to be dished up for the young men at Cardiff next month, he thought; here, on his terrace, he was merely foraging and picnicking (he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly) like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses, or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood.\n","Processing asent: It was all familiar; this turning, that stile, that cut across the fields.\n","Processing asent: Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons, which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there, the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes, with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot alone.\n","Processing asent: He reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath.\n","Processing asent: It was his fate, his peculiarity, whether he wished it or not, to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away, and there to stand, like a desolate sea-bird, alone.\n","Processing asent: It was his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand onthat was his fate, his gift.\n","Processing asent: But having thrown away, when he dismounted, all gestures and fripperies, all trophies of nuts and roses, and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him, kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision, and it was in this guise that he inspired in William Bankes (intermittently) and in Charles Tansley (obsequiously)and in his wife now, when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn, profoundly, reverence, and pity, and gratitude too, as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat-loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone.\n","Processing asent: \"But the father of eight children has no choice.\"\n","Processing asent: Muttering half aloud, so he broke off, turned, sighed, raised his eyes, sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy, filled his pipe.\n","Processing asent: He turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on, which, had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something; and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over, to deprecate it, as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes.\n","Processing asent: It was true; he was for the most part happy; he had his wife; he had his children; he had promised in six weeks' time to talk \"some nonsense\" to the young men of Cardiff about Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and the causes of the French Revolution.\n","Processing asent: But this and his pleasure in it, his glory in the phrases he made, in the ardour of youth, in his wife's beauty, in the tributes that reached him from Swansea, Cardiff, Exeter, Southampton, Kidderminster, Oxford, Cambridgeall had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase \"talking nonsense,\" because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might have done.\n","Processing asent: It was a disguise; it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings, who could not say, This is what I likethis is what I am; and rather pitiable and distasteful to William Bankes and Lily Briscoe, who wondered why such concealments should be necessary; why he needed always praise; why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life; how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.\n","Processing asent: Teaching and preaching is beyond human power, Lily suspected.\n","Processing asent: (She was putting away her things.)\n","Processing asent: If you are exalted you must somehow come a cropper.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay gave him what he asked too easily.\n","Processing asent: Then the change must be so upsetting, Lily said.\n","Processing asent: He comes in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking nonsense.\n","Processing asent: Imagine what a change from the things he thinks about, she said.\n","Processing asent: He was bearing down upon them.\n","Processing asent: Now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea.\n","Processing asent: Now he had turned away again.\n","Processing asent: Yes, Mr. Bankes said, watching him go.\n","Processing asent: It was a thousand pities.\n","Processing asent: (Lily had said something about his frightening herhe changed from one mood to another so suddenly.)\n","Processing asent: Yes, said Mr. Bankes, it was a thousand pities that Ramsay could not behave a little more like other people.\n","Processing asent: (For he liked Lily Briscoe; he could discuss Ramsay with her quite openly.)\n","Processing asent: It was for that reason, he said, that the young don't read Carlyle.\n","Processing asent: A crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold, why should he preach to us?\n","Processing asent: was what Mr. Bankes understood that young people said nowadays.\n","Processing asent: It was a thousand pities if you thought, as he did, that Carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind.\n","Processing asent: Lily was ashamed to say that she had not read Carlyle since she was at school.\n","Processing asent: But in her opinion one liked Mr. Ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end.\n","Processing asent: It was not THAT she minded.\n","Processing asent: For who could be deceived by him?\n","Processing asent: He asked you quite openly to flatter him, to admire him, his little dodges deceived nobody.\n","Processing asent: What she disliked was his narrowness, his blindness, she said, looking after him.\n","Processing asent: \"A bit of a hypocrite?\"\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes suggested, looking too at Mr. Ramsay's back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of Cam refusing to give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls, and his own house, full of comfort, but, since his wife's death, quiet rather?\n","Processing asent: Of course, he had his work...All the same, he rather wished Lily to agree that Ramsay was, as he said, \"a bit of a hypocrite.\"\n","Processing asent: Lily Briscoe went on putting away her brushes, looking up, looking down.\n","Processing asent: Looking up, there he wasMr.\n","Processing asent: Ramsayadvancing towards them, swinging, careless, oblivious, remote.\n","Processing asent: A bit of a hypocrite?\n","Processing asent: she repeated.\n","Processing asent: Oh, nothe most sincere of men, the truest (here he was), the best; but, looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in himself, he is tyrannical, he is unjust; and kept looking down, purposely, for only so could she keep steady, staying with the Ramsays.\n","Processing asent: Directly one looked up and saw them, what she called \"being in love\" flooded them.\n","Processing asent: They became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love.\n","Processing asent: The sky stuck to them; the birds sang through them.\n","Processing asent: And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she saw Mr. Ramsay bearing down and retreating, and Mrs. Ramsay sitting with James in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes expected her to answer.\n","Processing asent: And she was about to say something criticizing Mrs. Ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her way, high-handed, or words to that effect, when Mr. Bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture.\n","Processing asent: For such it was considering his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his impersonality, and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him.\n","Processing asent: For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs. Ramsay was a rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young men (and perhaps Mrs. Ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men).\n","Processing asent: It was love, she thought, pretending to move her canvas, distilled and filtered; love that never attempted to clutch its object; but, like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols, or poets their phrases, was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain.\n","Processing asent: So it was indeed.\n","Processing asent: The world by all means should have shared it, could Mr. Bankes have said why that woman pleased him so; why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in contemplation of it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants, that barbarity was tamed, the reign of chaos subdued.\n","Processing asent: Such a rapturefor by what other name could one call it?made Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say.\n","Processing asent: It was nothing of importance; something about Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: It paled beside this \"rapture,\" this silent stare, for which she felt intense gratitude; for nothing so solaced her, eased her of the perplexity of life, and miraculously raised its burdens, as this sublime power, this heavenly gift, and one would no more disturb it, while it lasted, than break up the shaft of sunlight, lying level across the floor.\n","Processing asent: That people should love like this, that Mr. Bankes should feel this for Mrs. Ramsey (she glanced at him musing) was helpful, was exalting.\n","Processing asent: She wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old rag, menially, on purpose.\n","Processing asent: She took shelter from the reverence which covered all women; she felt herself praised.\n","Processing asent: Let him gaze; she would steal a look at her picture.\n","Processing asent: She could have wept.\n","Processing asent: It was bad, it was bad, it was infinitely bad!\n","Processing asent: She could have done it differently of course; the colour could have been thinned and faded; the shapes etherealised; that was how Paunceforte would have seen it.\n","Processing asent: But then she did not see it like that.\n","Processing asent: She saw the colour burning on a framework of steel; the light of a butterfly's wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral.\n","Processing asent: Of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained.\n","Processing asent: And it would never be seen; never be hung even, and there was Mr. Tansley whispering in her ear, \"Women can't paint, women can't write...\"\n","Processing asent: She now remembered what she had been going to say about Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: She did not know how she would have put it; but it would have been something critical.\n","Processing asent: She had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness.\n","Processing asent: Looking along the level of Mr. Bankes's glance at her, she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped; they could only seek shelter under the shade which Mr. Bankes extended over them both.\n","Processing asent: Looking along his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people (bowed over her book); the best perhaps; but also, different too from the perfect shape which one saw there.\n","Processing asent: But why different, and how different?\n","Processing asent: she asked herself, scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now, yet she vowed, she would inspire them, force them to move, flow, do her bidding tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: How did she differ?\n","Processing asent: What was the spirit in her, the essential thing, by which, had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa, you would have known it, from its twisted finger, hers indisputably?\n","Processing asent: She was like a bird for speed, an arrow for directness.\n","Processing asent: She was willful; she was commanding (of course, Lily reminded herself, I am thinking of her relations with women, and I am much younger, an insignificant person, living off the Brompton Road).\n","Processing asent: She opened bedroom windows.\n","Processing asent: She shut doors.\n","Processing asent: (So she tried to start the tune of Mrs. Ramsay in her head.)\n","Processing asent: Arriving late at night, with a light tap on one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her beauty was always thathasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it might beCharles Tansley losing his umbrella; Mr. Carmichael snuffling and sniffing; Mr. Bankes saying, \"The vegetable salts are lost.\"\n","Processing asent: All this she would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the window, in pretence that she must go,it was dawn, she could see the sun rising,half turn back, more intimately, but still always laughing, insist that she must, Minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her (but Mrs. Ramsay cared not a fig for her painting), or triumphs won by her (probably Mrs. Ramsay had had her share of those), and here she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.\n","Processing asent: The house seemed full of children sleeping and Mrs. Ramsay listening; shaded lights and regular breathing.\n","Processing asent: Oh, but, Lily would say, there was her father; her home; even, had she dared to say it, her painting.\n","Processing asent: But all this seemed so little, so virginal, against the other.\n","Processing asent: Yet, as the night wore on, and white lights parted the curtains, and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden, gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law; plead for it; she liked to be alone; she liked to be herself; she was not made for that; and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth, and confront Mrs. Ramsay's simple certainty (and she was childlike now) that her dear Lily, her little Brisk, was a fool.\n","Processing asent: Then, she remembered, she had laid her head on Mrs. Ramsay's lap and laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost hysterically at the thought of Mrs. Ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand.\n","Processing asent: There she sat, simple, serious.\n","Processing asent: She had recovered her sense of her nowthis was the glove's twisted finger.\n","Processing asent: But into what sanctuary had one penetrated?\n","Processing asent: Lily Briscoe had looked up at last, and there was Mrs. Ramsay, unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter, still presiding, but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished, and in its stead, something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncoverthe little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon.\n","Processing asent: Was it wisdom?\n","Processing asent: Was it knowledge?\n","Processing asent: Was it, once more, the deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one's perceptions, half way to truth, were tangled in a golden mesh?\n","Processing asent: or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all?\n","Processing asent: Every one could not be as helter skelter, hand to mouth as she was.\n","Processing asent: But if they knew, could they tell one what they knew?\n","Processing asent: Sitting on the floor with her arms round Mrs. Ramsay's knees, close as she could get, smiling to think that Mrs. Ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out, would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly, never made public.\n","Processing asent: What art was there, known to love or cunning, by which one pressed through into those secret chambers?\n","Processing asent: What device for becoming, like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one adored?\n","Processing asent: Could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain?\n","Processing asent: or the heart?\n","Processing asent: Could loving, as people called it, make her and Mrs. Ramsay one?\n","Processing asent: for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her head on Mrs. Ramsay's knee.\n","Processing asent: Nothing happened.\n","Processing asent: Nothing!\n","Processing asent: Nothing! as she leant her head against Mrs. Ramsay's knee.\n","Processing asent: And yet, she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up in Mrs. Ramsay's heart.\n","Processing asent: How, then, she had asked herself, did one know one thing or another thing about people, sealed as they were?\n","Processing asent: Only like a bee, drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste, one haunted the dome-shaped hive, ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone, and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings; the hives, which were people.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay rose.\n","Processing asent: Lily rose.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay went.\n","Processing asent: For days there hung about her, as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring and, as she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she wore, to Lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.\n","Processing asent: This ray passed level with Mr. Bankes's ray straight to Mrs. Ramsay sitting reading there with James at her knee.\n","Processing asent: But now while she still looked, Mr. Bankes had done.\n","Processing asent: He had put on his spectacles.\n","Processing asent: He had stepped back.\n","Processing asent: He had raised his hand.\n","Processing asent: He had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes, when Lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it.\n","Processing asent: She would have snatched her picture off the easel, but she said to herself, One must.\n","Processing asent: She braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture.\n","Processing asent: One must, she said, one must.\n","Processing asent: And if it must be seen, Mr. Bankes was less alarming than another.\n","Processing asent: But that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty-three years, the deposit of each day's living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony.\n","Processing asent: At the same time it was immensely exciting.\n","Processing asent: Nothing could be cooler and quieter.\n","Processing asent: Taking out a pen-knife, Mr. Bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle.\n","Processing asent: What did she wish to indicate by the triangular purple shape, \"just there\"?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: It was Mrs. Ramsay reading to James, she said.\n","Processing asent: She knew his objection that no one could tell it for a human shape.\n","Processing asent: But she had made no attempt at likeness, she said.\n","Processing asent: For what reason had she introduced them then?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: Why indeed?except that if there, in that corner, it was bright, here, in this, she felt the need of darkness.\n","Processing asent: Simple, obvious, commonplace, as it was, Mr. Bankes was interested.\n","Processing asent: Mother and child thenobjects of universal veneration, and in this case the mother was famous for her beautymight be reduced, he pondered, to a purple shadow without irreverence.\n","Processing asent: But the picture was not of them, she said.\n","Processing asent: Or, not in his sense.\n","Processing asent: There were other senses too in which one might reverence them.\n","Processing asent: By a shadow here and a light there, for instance.\n","Processing asent: Her tribute took that form if, as she vaguely supposed, a picture must be a tribute.\n","Processing asent: A mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence.\n","Processing asent: A light here required a shadow there.\n","Processing asent: He considered.\n","Processing asent: He was interested.\n","Processing asent: He took it scientifically in complete good faith.\n","Processing asent: The truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side, he explained.\n","Processing asent: The largest picture in his drawing-room, which painters had praised, and valued at a higher price than he had given for it, was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the Kennet.\n","Processing asent: He had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he said.\n","Processing asent: Lily must come and see that picture, he said.\n","Processing asent: But nowhe turned, with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas.\n","Processing asent: The question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and shadows, which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he would like to have it explainedwhat then did she wish to make of it?\n","Processing asent: And he indicated the scene before them.\n","Processing asent: She looked.\n","Processing asent: She could not show him what she wished to make of it, could not see it even herself, without a brush in her hand.\n","Processing asent: She took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent-minded manner, subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and childrenher picture.\n","Processing asent: It was a question, she remembered, how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left.\n","Processing asent: She might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so; or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object (James perhaps) so.\n","Processing asent: But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.\n","Processing asent: She stopped; she did not want to bore him; she took the canvas lightly off the easel.\n","Processing asent: But it had been seen; it had been taken from her.\n","Processing asent: This man had shared with her something profoundly intimate.\n","Processing asent: And, thanking Mr. Ramsay for it and Mrs. Ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with a power which she had not suspectedthat one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebodythe strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilaratingshe nicked the catch of her paint-box to, more firmly than was necessary, and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn, Mr. Bankes, and that wild villain, Cam, dashing past.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 10\n","Processing asent: For Cam grazed the easel by an inch; she would not stop for Mr. Bankes and Lily Briscoe; though Mr. Bankes, who would have liked a daughter of his own, held out his hand; she would not stop for her father, whom she grazed also by an inch; nor for her mother, who called \"Cam! I want you a moment!\" as she dashed past.\n","Processing asent: She was off like a bird, bullet, or arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who could say?\n","Processing asent: What, what?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay pondered, watching her.\n","Processing asent: It might be a visionof a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew.\n","Processing asent: But when Mrs. Ramsay called \"Cam!\" a second time, the projectile dropped in mid career, and Cam came lagging back, pulling a leaf by the way, to her mother.\n","Processing asent: What was she dreaming about, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, seeing her engrossed, as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so that she had to repeat the message twiceask Mildred if Andrew, Miss Doyle, and Mr. Rayley have come back?The words seemed to be dropped into a well, where, if the waters were clear, they were also so extraordinarily distorting that, even as they descended, one saw them twisting about to make Heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child's mind.\n","Processing asent: What message would Cam give the cook?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay wondered.\n","Processing asent: And indeed it was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that Mrs. Ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up Mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one waited, in a colourless singsong.\n","Processing asent: Shifting from foot to foot, Cam repeated the words, \"No, they haven't, and I've told Ellen to clear away tea.\"\n","Processing asent: Minta Doyle and Paul Rayley had not come back then.\n","Processing asent: That could only mean, Mrs. Ramsay thought, one thing.\n","Processing asent: She must accept him, or she must refuse him.\n","Processing asent: This going off after luncheon for a walk, even though Andrew was with themwhat could it mean?\n","Processing asent: except that she had decided, rightly, Mrs. Ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of Minta), to accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought Mrs. Ramsay, realising that James was tugging at her, to make her go on reading aloud the Fisherman and his Wife, she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations; Charles Tansley, for instance.\n","Processing asent: Anyhow it must have happened, one way or the other, by now.\n","Processing asent: But she read, \"Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her. Her husband was still stretching himself...\"\n","Processing asent: But how could Minta say now that she would not have him?\n","Processing asent: Not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alonefor Andrew would be off after his crabsbut possibly Nancy was with them.\n","Processing asent: She tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch.\n","Processing asent: There they stood, looking at the sky, wondering about the weather, and she had said, thinking partly to cover their shyness, partly to encourage them to be off (for her sympathies were with Paul),\n","Processing asent: \"There isn't a cloud anywhere within miles,\" at which she could feel little Charles Tansley, who had followed them out, snigger.\n","Processing asent: But she did it on purpose.\n","Processing asent: Whether Nancy was there or not, she could not be certain, looking from one to the other in her mind's eye.\n","Processing asent: She read on: \"Ah, wife,\" said the man, \"why should we be King? I do not want to be King.\" \"Well,\" said the wife, \"if you won't be King, I will; go to the Flounder, for I will be King.\"\n","Processing asent: \"Come in or go out, Cam,\" she said, knowing that Cam was attracted only by the word \"Flounder\" and that in a moment she would fidget and fight with James as usual.\n","Processing asent: Cam shot off.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay went on reading, relieved, for she and James shared the same tastes and were comfortable together.\n","Processing asent: \"And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark grey, and the water heaved up from below, and smelt putrid.\n","Processing asent: Then he went and stood by it and said,\n","Processing asent: 'Flounder, flounder, in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me; For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I'd have her will.\n","Processing asent: 'Well, what does she want then?' said the Flounder.\n","Processing asent: \" And where were they now? Mrs. Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she be told? If nothing happened, she would have to speak seriously to Minta. For she could not go trapesing about all over the country, even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them). She was responsible to Minta's parentsthe Owl and the Poker. Her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read. The Owl and the Pokeryes, they would be annoyed if they heardand they were certain to hearthat Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. \"He wore a wig in the House of Commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs,\" she repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband. Dear, dear, Mrs. Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking? How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploitsinteresting perhaps, but limited after allof that bird? Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her husband that night, coming back from the party). However, Minta came...Yes, she came, Mrs. Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a woman had once accused her of \"robbing her of her daughter's affections\"; something Mrs. Doyle had said made her remember that charge again. Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wishedthat was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. How could she help being \"like that\" to look at?\n","Processing asent: No one could accuse her of taking pains to impress.\n","Processing asent: She was often ashamed of her own shabbiness.\n","Processing asent: Nor was she domineering, nor was she tyrannical.\n","Processing asent: It was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy.\n","Processing asent: About things like that she did feel passionately, and would, if she had the chance, have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see.\n","Processing asent: No hospital on the whole island.\n","Processing asent: It was a disgrace.\n","Processing asent: Milk delivered at your door in London positively brown with dirt.\n","Processing asent: It should be made illegal.\n","Processing asent: A model dairy and a hospital up herethose two things she would have liked to do, herself.\n","Processing asent: But how?\n","Processing asent: With all these children?\n","Processing asent: When they were older, then perhaps she would have time; when they were all at school.\n","Processing asent: Oh, but she never wanted James to grow a day older! or Cam either.\n","Processing asent: These two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were, demons of wickedness, angels of delight, never to see them grow up into long-legged monsters.\n","Processing asent: Nothing made up up for the loss.\n","Processing asent: When she read just now to James, \"and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets,\" and his eyes darkened, she thought, why should they grow up and lose all that?\n","Processing asent: He was the most gifted, the most sensitive of her children.\n","Processing asent: But all, she thought, were full of promise.\n","Processing asent: Prue, a perfect angel with the others, and sometimes now, at night especially, she took one's breath away with her beauty.\n","Processing asent: Andreweven her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary.\n","Processing asent: And Nancy and Roger, they were both wild creatures now, scampering about over the country all day long.\n","Processing asent: As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had a wonderful gift with her hands.\n","Processing asent: If they had charades, Rose made the dresses; made everything; liked best arranging tables, flowers, anything.\n","Processing asent: She did not like it that Jasper should shoot birds; but it was only a stage; they all went through stages.\n","Processing asent: Why, she asked, pressing her chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast?\n","Processing asent: Why should they go to school?\n","Processing asent: She would have liked always to have had a baby.\n","Processing asent: She was happiest carrying one in her arms.\n","Processing asent: Then people might say she was tyrannical, domineering, masterful, if they chose; she did not mind.\n","Processing asent: And, touching his hair with her lips, she thought, he will never be so happy again, but stopped herself, remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that.\n","Processing asent: Still, it was true.\n","Processing asent: They were happier now than they would ever be again.\n","Processing asent: A tenpenny tea set made Cam happy for days.\n","Processing asent: She heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke.\n","Processing asent: They came bustling along the passage.\n","Processing asent: Then the door sprang open and in they came, fresh as roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the dining-room after breakfast, which they did every day of their lives, was a positive event to them, and so on, with one thing after another, all day long, until she went up to say good-night to them, and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries, still making up stories about some little bit of rubbishsomething they had heard, something they had picked up in the garden.\n","Processing asent: They all had their little treasures...And so she went down and said to her husband, Why must they grow up and lose it all?\n","Processing asent: Never will they be so happy again.\n","Processing asent: And he was angry.\n","Processing asent: Why take such a gloomy view of life?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: It is not sensible.\n","Processing asent: For it was odd; and she believed it to be true; that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier, more hopeful on the whole, than she was.\n","Processing asent: Less exposed to human worriesperhaps that was it.\n","Processing asent: He had always his work to fall back on.\n","Processing asent: Not that she herself was \"pessimistic,\" as he accused her of being.\n","Processing asent: Only she thought lifeand a little strip of time presented itself to her eyesher fifty years.\n","Processing asent: There it was before herlife.\n","Processing asent: Life, she thoughtbut she did not finish her thought.\n","Processing asent: She took a look at life, for she had a clear sense of it there, something real, something private, which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband.\n","Processing asent: A sort of transaction went on between them, in which she was on one side, and life was on another, and she was always trying to get the better of it, as it was of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when she sat alone); there were, she remembered, great reconciliation scenes; but for the most part, oddly enough, she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance.\n","Processing asent: There were eternal problems: suffering; death; the poor.\n","Processing asent: There was always a woman dying of cancer even here.\n","Processing asent: And yet she had said to all these children, You shall go through it all.\n","Processing asent: To eight people she had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds).\n","Processing asent: For that reason, knowing what was before themlove and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary placesshe had often the feeling, Why must they grow up and lose it all?\n","Processing asent: And then she said to herself, brandishing her sword at life, Nonsense.\n","Processing asent: They will be perfectly happy.\n","Processing asent: And here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because whatever she might feel about her own transaction, she had had experiences which need not happen to every one (she did not name them to herself); she was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for her too, to say that people must marry; people must have children.\n","Processing asent: Was she wrong in this, she asked herself, reviewing her conduct for the past week or two, and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon Minta, who was only twenty-four, to make up her mind.\n","Processing asent: She was uneasy.\n","Processing asent: Had she not laughed about it?\n","Processing asent: Was she not forgetting again how strongly she influenced people?\n","Processing asent: Marriage neededoh, all sorts of qualities (the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds); oneshe need not name itthat was essential; the thing she had with her husband.\n","Processing asent: Had they that?\n","Processing asent: \"Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman,\" she read.\n","Processing asent: \"But outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet; houses and trees toppled over, the mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was pitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains, and all with white foam at the top.\"\n","Processing asent: She turned the page; there were only a few lines more, so that she would finish the story, though it was past bed-time.\n","Processing asent: It was getting late.\n","Processing asent: The light in the garden told her that; and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together, to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety.\n","Processing asent: What it was about she could not think at first.\n","Processing asent: Then she remembered; Paul and Minta and Andrew had not come back.\n","Processing asent: She summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door, standing looking up into the sky.\n","Processing asent: Andrew had his net and basket.\n","Processing asent: That meant he was going to catch crabs and things.\n","Processing asent: That meant he would climb out on to a rock; he would be cut off.\n","Processing asent: Or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip.\n","Processing asent: He would roll and then crash.\n","Processing asent: It was growing quite dark.\n","Processing asent: But she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story, and added, shutting the book, and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself, looking into James's eyes: \"And there they are living still at this very time.\"\n","Processing asent: \"And that's the end,\" she said, and she saw in his eyes, as the interest of the story died away in them, something else take its place; something wondering, pale, like the reflection of a light, which at once made him gaze and marvel.\n","Processing asent: Turning, she looked across the bay, and there, sure enough, coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke, was the light of the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: It had been lit.\n","Processing asent: In a moment he would ask her, \"Are we going to the Lighthouse?\"\n","Processing asent: And she would have to say, \"No: not tomorrow; your father says not.\"\n","Processing asent: Happily, Mildred came in to fetch them, and the bustle distracted them.\n","Processing asent: But he kept looking back over his shoulder as Mildred carried him out, and she was certain that he was thinking, we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she thought, he will remember that all his life.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 11\n","Processing asent: No, she thought, putting together some of the pictures he had cut out a refrigerator, a mowing machine, a gentleman in evening dress children never forget.\n","Processing asent: For this reason, it was so important what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went to bed.\n","Processing asent: For now she need not think about anybody.\n","Processing asent: She could be herself, by herself.\n","Processing asent: And that was what now she often felt the need ofto think; well, not even to think.\n","Processing asent: To be silent; to be alone.\n","Processing asent: All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others.\n","Processing asent: Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures.\n","Processing asent: When life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless.\n","Processing asent: And to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources, she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish.\n","Processing asent: Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by.\n","Processing asent: Her horizon seemed to her limitless.\n","Processing asent: There were all the places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in Rome.\n","Processing asent: This core of darkness could go anywhere, for no one saw it.\n","Processing asent: They could not stop it, she thought, exulting.\n","Processing asent: There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most welcome of all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform of stability.\n","Processing asent: Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness.\n","Processing asent: Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke.\n","Processing asent: Often she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked atthat light, for example.\n","Processing asent: And it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that\"Children don't forget, children don't forget\"which she would repeat and begin adding to it, It will end, it will end, she said.\n","Processing asent: It will come, it will come, when suddenly she added, We are in the hands of the Lord.\n","Processing asent: But instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that.\n","Processing asent: Who had said it?\n","Processing asent: Not she; she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean.\n","Processing asent: She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes, searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart, purifying out of existence that lie, any lie.\n","Processing asent: She praised herself in praising the light, without vanity, for she was stern, she was searching, she was beautiful like that light.\n","Processing asent: It was odd, she thought, how if one was alone, one leant to inanimate things; trees, streams, flowers; felt they expressed one; felt they became one; felt they knew one, in a sense were one; felt an irrational tenderness thus (she looked at that long steady light) as for oneself.\n","Processing asent: There rose, and she looked and looked with her needles suspended, there curled up off the floor of the mind, rose from the lake of one's being, a mist, a bride to meet her lover.\n","Processing asent: What brought her to say that: \"We are in the hands of the Lord?\" she wondered.\n","Processing asent: The insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her, annoyed her.\n","Processing asent: She returned to her knitting again.\n","Processing asent: How could any Lord have made this world?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: With her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death, the poor.\n","Processing asent: There was no treachery too base for the world to commit; she knew that.\n","Processing asent: No happiness lasted; she knew that.\n","Processing asent: She knitted with firm composure, slightly pursing her lips and, without being aware of it, so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed, though he was chuckling at the thought that Hume, the philosopher, grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog, he could not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of her beauty.\n","Processing asent: It saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached the hedge, he was sad.\n","Processing asent: He could do nothing to help her.\n","Processing asent: He must stand by and watch her.\n","Processing asent: Indeed, the infernal truth was, he made things worse for her.\n","Processing asent: He was irritablehe was touchy.\n","Processing asent: He had lost his temper over the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: He looked into the hedge, into its intricacy, its darkness.\n","Processing asent: Always, Mrs. Ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound, some sight.\n","Processing asent: She listened, but it was all very still; cricket was over; the children were in their baths; there was only the sound of the sea.\n","Processing asent: She stopped knitting; she held the long reddish-brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment.\n","Processing asent: She saw the light again.\n","Processing asent: With some irony in her interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she looked at the steady light, the pitiless, the remorseless, which was so much her, yet so little her, which had her at its beck and call (she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed, stroking the floor), but for all that she thought, watching it with fascination, hypnotised, as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt, It is enough!\n","Processing asent: It is enough!\n","Processing asent: He turned and saw her.\n","Processing asent: She was lovely, lovelier now than ever he thought.\n","Processing asent: But he could not speak to her.\n","Processing asent: He could not interrupt her.\n","Processing asent: He wanted urgently to speak to her now that James was gone and she was alone at last.\n","Processing asent: But he resolved, no; he would not interrupt her.\n","Processing asent: She was aloof from him now in her beauty, in her sadness.\n","Processing asent: He would let her be, and he passed her without a word, though it hurt him that she should look so distant, and he could not reach her, he could do nothing to help her.\n","Processing asent: And again he would have passed her without a word had she not, at that very moment, given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask, and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame, and gone to him.\n","Processing asent: For he wished, she knew, to protect her.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 12\n","Processing asent: She folded the green shawl about her shoulders.\n","Processing asent: She took his arm.\n","Processing asent: His beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of Kennedy the gardener, at once he was so awfully handsome, that she couldn't dismiss him.\n","Processing asent: There was a ladder against the greenhouse, and little lumps of putty stuck about, for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse.\n","Processing asent: Yes, but as she strolled along with her husband, she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed.\n","Processing asent: She had it on the tip of her tongue to say, as they strolled, \"It'll cost fifty pounds,\" but instead, for her heart failed her about money, she talked about Jasper shooting birds, and he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long.\n","Processing asent: Her husband was so sensible, so just.\n","Processing asent: And so she said, \"Yes; all children go through stages,\" and began considering the dahlias in the big bed, and wondering what about next year's flowers, and had he heard the children's nickname for Charles Tansley, she asked.\n","Processing asent: The atheist, they called him, the little atheist.\n","Processing asent: \"He's not a polished specimen,\" said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Far from it,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices, Mrs. Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did they plant them?\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, he has his dissertation to write,\" said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: She knew all about THAT, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: He talked of nothing else.\n","Processing asent: It was about the influence of somebody upon something.\n","Processing asent: \"Well, it's all he has to count on,\" said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Pray Heaven he won't fall in love with Prue,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: He'd disinherit her if she married him, said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: He did not look at the flowers, which his wife was considering, but at a spot about a foot or so above them.\n","Processing asent: There was no harm in him, he added, and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in England who admired hiswhen he choked it back.\n","Processing asent: He would not bother her again about his books.\n","Processing asent: These flowers seemed creditable, Mr. Ramsay said, lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown.\n","Processing asent: Yes, but then these she had put in with her own hands, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: The question was, what happened if she sent bulbs down; did Kennedy plant them?\n","Processing asent: It was his incurable laziness; she added, moving on.\n","Processing asent: If she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand, he did sometimes do a stroke of work.\n","Processing asent: So they strolled along, towards the red-hot pokers.\n","Processing asent: \"You're teaching your daughters to exaggerate,\" said Mr. Ramsay, reproving her.\n","Processing asent: Her Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was, Mrs. Ramsay remarked.\n","Processing asent: \"Nobody ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of virtue that I'm aware of,\" said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"She was the most beautiful woman I ever saw,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Somebody else was that,\" said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: Prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: He saw no trace of it, said Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Well, then, look tonight,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: They paused.\n","Processing asent: He wished Andrew could be induced to work harder.\n","Processing asent: He would lose every chance of a scholarship if he didn't.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, scholarships!\" she said.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay thought her foolish for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship.\n","Processing asent: He should be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said.\n","Processing asent: She would be just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered.\n","Processing asent: They disagreed always about this, but it did not matter.\n","Processing asent: She liked him to believe in scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew whatever he did.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs.\n","Processing asent: Wasn't it late?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: They hadn't come home yet.\n","Processing asent: He flicked his watch carelessly open.\n","Processing asent: But it was only just past seven.\n","Processing asent: He held his watch open for a moment, deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace.\n","Processing asent: To begin with, it was not reasonable to be so nervous.\n","Processing asent: Andrew could look after himself.\n","Processing asent: Then, he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just nowhere he became uncomfortable, as if he were breaking into that solitude, that aloofness, that remoteness of hers.\n","Processing asent: But she pressed him.\n","Processing asent: What had he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going to the Lighthouse; that he was sorry he had said \"Damn you.\"\n","Processing asent: But no.\n","Processing asent: He did not like to see her look so sad, he said.\n","Processing asent: Only wool gathering, she protested, flushing a little.\n","Processing asent: They both felt uncomfortable, as if they did not know whether to go on or go back.\n","Processing asent: She had been reading fairy tales to James, she said.\n","Processing asent: No, they could not share that; they could not say that.\n","Processing asent: They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot pokers, and there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at it.\n","Processing asent: Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would not have let herself sit there, thinking.\n","Processing asent: She disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking.\n","Processing asent: So she looked over her shoulder, at the town.\n","Processing asent: The lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind.\n","Processing asent: And all the poverty, all the suffering had turned to that, Mrs. Ramsay thought.\n","Processing asent: The lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk.\n","Processing asent: Well, if he could not share her thoughts, Mr. Ramsay said to himself, he would be off, then, on his own.\n","Processing asent: He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the story how Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh.\n","Processing asent: But first it was nonsense to be anxious about Andrew.\n","Processing asent: When he was Andrew's age he used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought that he had fallen over a cliff.\n","Processing asent: He said aloud he thought he would be off for a day's walk if the weather held.\n","Processing asent: He had had about enough of Bankes and of Carmichael.\n","Processing asent: He would like a little solitude.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she said.\n","Processing asent: It annoyed him that she did not protest.\n","Processing asent: She knew that he would never do it.\n","Processing asent: He was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket.\n","Processing asent: She worried about the boys, but not about him.\n","Processing asent: Years ago, before he had married, he thought, looking across the bay, as they stood between the clumps of red-hot pokers, he had walked all day.\n","Processing asent: He had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house.\n","Processing asent: He had worked ten hours at a stretch; an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire.\n","Processing asent: That was the country he liked best, over there; those sandhills dwindling away into darkness.\n","Processing asent: One could walk all day without meeting a soul.\n","Processing asent: There was not a house scarcely, not a single village for miles on end.\n","Processing asent: One could worry things out alone.\n","Processing asent: There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time.\n","Processing asent: The seals sat up and looked at you.\n","Processing asent: It sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there, alonehe broke off, sighing.\n","Processing asent: He had no right.\n","Processing asent: The father of eight childrenhe reminded himself.\n","Processing asent: And he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered.\n","Processing asent: Andrew would be a better man than he had been.\n","Processing asent: Prue would be a beauty, her mother said.\n","Processing asent: They would stem the flood a bit.\n","Processing asent: That was a good bit of work on the wholehis eight children.\n","Processing asent: They showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely, for on an evening like this, he thought, looking at the land dwindling away, the little island seemed pathetically small, half swallowed up in the sea.\n","Processing asent: \"Poor little place,\" he murmured with a sigh.\n","Processing asent: She heard him.\n","Processing asent: He said the most melancholy things, but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual.\n","Processing asent: All this phrase-making was a game, she thought, for if she had said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now.\n","Processing asent: It annoyed her, this phrase-making, and she said to him, in a matter- of-fact way, that it was a perfectly lovely evening.\n","Processing asent: And what was he groaning about, she asked, half laughing, half complaining, for she guessed what he was thinkinghe would have written better books if he had not married.\n","Processing asent: He was not complaining, he said.\n","Processing asent: She knew that he did not complain.\n","Processing asent: She knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of.\n","Processing asent: And he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes, and quickly he dropped it.\n","Processing asent: They turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm.\n","Processing asent: His arm was almost like a young man's arm, Mrs. Ramsay thought, thin and hard, and she thought with delight how strong he still was, though he was over sixty, and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange it was that being convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors, seemed not to depress him, but to cheer him.\n","Processing asent: Was it not odd, she reflected?\n","Processing asent: Indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people, born blind, deaf, and dumb, to the ordinary things, but to the extraordinary things, with an eye like an eagle's.\n","Processing asent: His understanding often astonished her.\n","Processing asent: But did he notice the flowers?\n","Processing asent: Did he notice the view?\n","Processing asent: Did he even notice his own daughter's beauty, or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef?\n","Processing asent: He would sit at table with them like a person in a dream.\n","Processing asent: And his habit of talking aloud, or saying poetry aloud, was growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes it was awkward\n","Processing asent: Best and brightest come away!\n","Processing asent: poor Miss Giddings, when he shouted that at her, almost jumped out of her skin.\n","Processing asent: But then, Mrs. Ramsay, though instantly taking his side against all the silly Giddingses in the world, then, she thought, intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank, then, she thought, stooping down to look, a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours.\n","Processing asent: All the great men she had ever known, she thought, deciding that a rabbit must have got in, were like that, and it was good for young men (though the atmosphere of lecture-rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost) simply to hear him, simply to look at him.\n","Processing asent: But without shooting rabbits, how was one to keep them down?\n","Processing asent: she wondered.\n","Processing asent: It might be a rabbit; it might be a mole.\n","Processing asent: Some creature anyhow was ruining her Evening Primroses.\n","Processing asent: And looking up, she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full-throbbing star, and wanted to make her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen pleasure.\n","Processing asent: But she stopped herself.\n","Processing asent: He never looked at things.\n","Processing asent: If he did, all he would say would be, Poor little world, with one of his sighs.\n","Processing asent: At that moment, he said, \"Very fine,\" to please her, and pretended to admire the flowers.\n","Processing asent: But she knew quite well that he did not admire them, or even realise that they were there.\n","Processing asent: It was only to please her.\n","Processing asent: Ah, but was that not Lily Briscoe strolling along with William Bankes?\n","Processing asent: She focussed her short-sighted eyes upon the backs of a retreating couple.\n","Processing asent: Yes, indeed it was.\n","Processing asent: Did that not mean that they would marry?\n","Processing asent: Yes, it must!\n","Processing asent: What an admirable idea!\n","Processing asent: They must marry!\n","Processing asent: SECTION 13\n","Processing asent: He had been to Amsterdam, Mr. Bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with Lily Briscoe.\n","Processing asent: He had seen the Rembrandts.\n","Processing asent: He had been to Madrid.\n","Processing asent: Unfortunately, it was Good Friday and the Prado was shut.\n","Processing asent: He had been to Rome.\n","Processing asent: Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome?\n","Processing asent: Oh, she shouldIt would be a wonderful experience for herthe Sistine Chapel; Michael Angelo; and Padua, with its Giottos.\n","Processing asent: His wife had been in bad health for many years, so that their sight-seeing had been on a modest scale.\n","Processing asent: She had been to Brussels; she had been to Paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill.\n","Processing asent: She had been to Dresden; there were masses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily Briscoe reflected, perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they only made one hopelessly discontented with one's own work.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far.\n","Processing asent: We can't all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins, he said; at the same time he doubted whether you could have your Darwin and your Titian if it weren't for humble people like ourselves.\n","Processing asent: Lily would have liked to pay him a compliment; you're not humble, Mr. Bankes, she would have liked to have said.\n","Processing asent: But he did not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures.\n","Processing asent: Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting, because it interested her.\n","Processing asent: Yes, said Mr. Bankes, he was sure she would, and, as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw the Ramsays.\n","Processing asent: So that is marriage, Lily thought, a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball.\n","Processing asent: That is what Mrs. Ramsay tried to tell me the other night, she thought.\n","Processing asent: For she was wearing a green shawl, and they were standing close together watching Prue and Jasper throwing catches.\n","Processing asent: And suddenly the meaning which, for no reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the Tube or ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical, making them representative, came upon them, and made them in the dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife.\n","Processing asent: Then, after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again, and they became, as they met them, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay watching the children throwing catches.\n","Processing asent: But still for a moment, though Mrs. Ramsay greeted them with her usual smile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought) and said, \"I have triumphed tonight,\" meaning that for once Mr. Bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly; still, for one moment, there was a sense of things having been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches.\n","Processing asent: In the failing light they all looked sharp-edged and ethereal and divided by great distances.\n","Processing asent: Then, darting backwards over the vast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether), Prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand, and her mother said, \"Haven't they come back yet?\" whereupon the spell was broken.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that Hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the Lord's Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay, bringing Prue back into throwing catches again, from which she had escaped, asked,\n","Processing asent: \"Did Nancy go with them?\"\n","Processing asent: SECTION 14\n","Processing asent: (Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had asked it with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made off, after lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life.\n","Processing asent: She supposed she must go then.\n","Processing asent: She did not want to go.\n","Processing asent: She did not want to be drawn into it all.\n","Processing asent: For as they walked along the road to the cliff Minta kept on taking her hand.\n","Processing asent: Then she would let it go.\n","Processing asent: Then she would take it again.\n","Processing asent: What was it she wanted?\n","Processing asent: Nancy asked herself.\n","Processing asent: There was something, of course, that people wanted; for when Minta took her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw the whole world spread out beneath her, as if it were Constantinople seen through a mist, and then, however heavy-eyed one might be, one must needs ask, \"Is that Santa Sofia?\" \"Is that the Golden Horn?\"\n","Processing asent: So Nancy asked, when Minta took her hand.\n","Processing asent: \"What is it that she wants? Is it that?\"\n","Processing asent: And what was that?\n","Processing asent: Here and there emerged from the mist (as Nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her) a pinnacle, a dome; prominent things, without names.\n","Processing asent: But when Minta dropped her hand, as she did when they ran down the hillside, all that, the dome, the pinnacle, whatever it was that had protruded through the mist, sank down into it and disappeared.\n","Processing asent: Minta, Andrew observed, was rather a good walker.\n","Processing asent: She wore more sensible clothes that most women.\n","Processing asent: She wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers.\n","Processing asent: She would jump straight into a stream and flounder across.\n","Processing asent: He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would not doshe would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days.\n","Processing asent: She seemed to be afraid of nothingexcept bulls.\n","Processing asent: At the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming, which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course.\n","Processing asent: But she did not mind owning up to it in the least; one must admit that.\n","Processing asent: She knew she was an awful coward about bulls, she said.\n","Processing asent: She thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby.\n","Processing asent: She didn't seem to mind what she said or did.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about\n","Processing asent: Damn your eyes, damn your eyes.\n","Processing asent: They all had to join in and sing the chorus, and shout out together:\n","Processing asent: Damn your eyes, damn your eyes,\n","Processing asent: but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting-grounds before they got on to the beach.\n","Processing asent: \"Fatal,\" Paul agreed, springing up, and as they went slithering down, he kept quoting the guide-book about \"these islands being justly celebrated for their park-like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities.\"\n","Processing asent: But it would not do altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him \"old fellow\" and all that; it would not altogether do.\n","Processing asent: It was the worst of taking women on walks.\n","Processing asent: Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the Pope's Nose, taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves.\n","Processing asent: She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock.\n","Processing asent: Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down.\n","Processing asent: Out on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed, gauntleted, stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging the pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side.\n","Processing asent: And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon, she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotised, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingness.\n","Processing asent: So listening to the waves, crouching over the pool, she brooded.\n","Processing asent: And Andrew shouted that the sea was coming in, so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and thereoh, heavens! in each other's arms, were Paul and Minta kissing probably.\n","Processing asent: She was outraged, indignant.\n","Processing asent: She and Andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it.\n","Processing asent: Indeed they were rather sharp with each other.\n","Processing asent: She might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was, Andrew grumbled.\n","Processing asent: However, they both felt, it's not our fault.\n","Processing asent: They had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen.\n","Processing asent: All the same it irritated Andrew that Nancy should be a woman, and Nancy that Andrew should be a man, and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight.\n","Processing asent: It was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that Minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother's brooch her grandmother's brooch, the sole ornament she possesseda weeping willow, it was (they must remember it) set in pearls.\n","Processing asent: They must have seen it, she said, with the tears running down her cheeks, the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life.\n","Processing asent: Now she had lost it.\n","Processing asent: She would rather have lost anything than that!\n","Processing asent: She would go back and look for it.\n","Processing asent: They all went back.\n","Processing asent: They poked and peered and looked.\n","Processing asent: They kept their heads very low, and said things shortly and gruffly.\n","Processing asent: Paul Rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting.\n","Processing asent: All this pother about a brooch really didn't do at all, Andrew thought, as Paul told him to make a \"thorough search between this point and that.\"\n","Processing asent: The tide was coming in fast.\n","Processing asent: The sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute.\n","Processing asent: There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now.\n","Processing asent: \"We shall be cut off!\"\n","Processing asent: Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified.\n","Processing asent: As if there were any danger of that!\n","Processing asent: It was the same as the bulls all over againshe had no control over her emotions, Andrew thought.\n","Processing asent: Women hadn't.\n","Processing asent: The wretched Paul had to pacify her.\n","Processing asent: The men (Andrew and Paul at once became manly, and different from usual) took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing more that could be done now.\n","Processing asent: If the brooch was there, it would still be there in the morning, they assured her, but Minta still sobbed, all the way up to the top of the cliff.\n","Processing asent: It was her grandmother's brooch; she would rather have lost anything but that, and yet Nancy felt, it might be true that she minded losing her brooch, but she wasn't crying only for that.\n","Processing asent: She was crying for something else.\n","Processing asent: We might all sit down and cry, she felt.\n","Processing asent: But she did not know what for.\n","Processing asent: They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her, and said how famous he was for finding things.\n","Processing asent: Once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch.\n","Processing asent: He would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it.\n","Processing asent: It seemed to him that it would be almost dark, and he would be alone on the beach, and somehow it would be rather dangerous.\n","Processing asent: He began telling her, however, that he would certainly find it, and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn: it was lost: she knew that: she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon.\n","Processing asent: And secretly he resolved that he would not tell her, but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to Edinburgh and buy her another, just like it but more beautiful.\n","Processing asent: He would prove what he could do.\n","Processing asent: And as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to himhis marriage, his children, his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the high road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her, and she pressing close to his side (as she did now).\n","Processing asent: As they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through, and he must tell some oneMrs.\n","Processing asent: Ramsay of course, for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done.\n","Processing asent: It had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked Minta to marry him.\n","Processing asent: He would go straight to Mrs. Ramsay, because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it.\n","Processing asent: She had made him think he could do anything.\n","Processing asent: Nobody else took him seriously.\n","Processing asent: But she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted.\n","Processing asent: He had felt her eyes on him all day today, following him about (though she never said a word) as if she were saying, \"Yes, you can do it. I believe in you. I expect it of you.\"\n","Processing asent: She had made him feel all that, and directly they got back (he looked for the lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her and say, \"I've done it, Mrs. Ramsay; thanks to you.\"\n","Processing asent: And so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows.\n","Processing asent: They must be awfully late then.\n","Processing asent: People were getting ready for dinner.\n","Processing asent: The house was all lit up, and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly, as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff.\n","Processing asent: But, good heavens, he said to himself, putting his hand to his tie, I must not make a fool of myself.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 15\n","Processing asent: \"Yes,\" said Prue, in her considering way, answering her mother's question, \"I think Nancy did go with them.\"\n","Processing asent: SECTION 16\n","Processing asent: Well then, Nancy had gone with them, Mrs. Ramsay supposed, wondering, as she put down a brush, took up a comb, and said \"Come in\" to a tap at the door (Jasper and Rose came in), whether the fact that Nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen; it made it less likely, somehow, Mrs. Ramsay felt, very irrationally, except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable.\n","Processing asent: They could not all be drowned.\n","Processing asent: And again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist, life.\n","Processing asent: Jasper and Rose said that Mildred wanted to know whether she should wait dinner.\n","Processing asent: \"Not for the Queen of England,\" said Mrs. Ramsay emphatically.\n","Processing asent: \"Not for the Empress of Mexico,\" she added, laughing at Jasper; for he shared his mother's vice: he, too, exaggerated.\n","Processing asent: And if Rose liked, she said, while Jasper took the message, she might choose which jewels she was to wear.\n","Processing asent: When there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner, one cannot keep things waiting for ever.\n","Processing asent: She was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late; it was inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them, that they should choose this very night to be out late, when, in fact, she wished the dinner to be particularly nice, since William Bankes had at last consented to dine with them; and they were having Mildred's masterpieceBOEUF EN DAUBE.\n","Processing asent: Everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready.\n","Processing asent: The beef, the bayleaf, and the wineall must be done to a turn.\n","Processing asent: To keep it waiting was out of the question.\n","Processing asent: Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be kept hot; the BOEUF EN DAUBE would be entirely spoilt.\n","Processing asent: Jasper offered her an opal necklace; Rose a gold necklace.\n","Processing asent: Which looked best against her black dress?\n","Processing asent: Which did indeed, said Mrs. Ramsay absent-mindedly, looking at her neck and shoulders (but avoiding her face) in the glass.\n","Processing asent: And then, while the children rummaged among her things, she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused herthe rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on.\n","Processing asent: Every time, they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again, because, she thought, the old rook, the father rook, old Joseph was her name for him, was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition.\n","Processing asent: He was a disreputable old bird, with half his wing feathers missing.\n","Processing asent: He was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house.\n","Processing asent: \"Look!\" she said, laughing.\n","Processing asent: They were actually fighting.\n","Processing asent: Joseph and Mary were fighting.\n","Processing asent: Anyhow they all went up again, and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes.\n","Processing asent: The movements of the wings beating out, out, outshe could never describe it accurately enough to please herselfwas one of the loveliest of all to her.\n","Processing asent: Look at that, she said to Rose, hoping that Rose would see it more clearly than she could.\n","Processing asent: For one's children so often gave one's own perceptions a little thrust forwards.\n","Processing asent: But which was it to be?\n","Processing asent: They had all the trays of her jewel-case open.\n","Processing asent: The gold necklace, which was Italian, or the opal necklace, which Uncle James had brought her from India; or should she wear her amethysts?\n","Processing asent: \"Choose, dearests, choose,\" she said, hoping that they would make haste.\n","Processing asent: But she let them take their time to choose: she let Rose, particularly, take up this and then that, and hold her jewels against the black dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone through every night, was what Rose liked best, she knew.\n","Processing asent: She had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear.\n","Processing asent: What was the reason, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age.\n","Processing asent: Like all feelings felt for oneself, Mrs. Ramsay thought, it made one sad.\n","Processing asent: It was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what Rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was.\n","Processing asent: And Rose would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and Jasper, because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and Rose, as she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her the handkerchief), and what else?\n","Processing asent: oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl.\n","Processing asent: Choose me a shawl, she said, for that would please Rose, who was bound to suffer so.\n","Processing asent: \"There,\" she said, stopping by the window on the landing, \"there they are again.\"\n","Processing asent: Joseph had settled on another tree- top.\n","Processing asent: \"Don't you think they mind,\" she said to Jasper, \"having their wings broken?\"\n","Processing asent: Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and Mary?\n","Processing asent: He shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not seriously, for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds; and they did not feel; and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world, but he rather liked her stories about Mary and Joseph.\n","Processing asent: She made him laugh.\n","Processing asent: But how did she know that those were Mary and Joseph?\n","Processing asent: Did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: But here, suddenly, like all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the least attention.\n","Processing asent: She was listening to a clatter in the hall.\n","Processing asent: \"They've come back!\" she exclaimed, and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved.\n","Processing asent: Then she wondered, had it happened?\n","Processing asent: She would go down and they would tell herbut no.\n","Processing asent: They could not tell her anything, with all these people about.\n","Processing asent: So she must go down and begin dinner and wait.\n","Processing asent: And, like some queen who, finding her people gathered in the hall, looks down upon them, and descends among them, and acknowledges their tributes silently, and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her (Paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed) she went down, and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly, as if she accepted what they could not say: their tribute to her beauty.\n","Processing asent: But she stopped.\n","Processing asent: There was a smell of burning.\n","Processing asent: Could they have let the BOEUF EN DAUBE overboil?\n","Processing asent: she wondered, pray heaven not! when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly, authoritatively, that all those scattered about, in attics, in bedrooms, on little perches of their own, reading, writing, putting the last smooth to their hair, or fastening dresses, must leave all that, and the little odds and ends on their washing-tables and dressing tables, and the novels on the bed- tables, and the diaries which were so private, and assemble in the dining-room for dinner.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 17\n","Processing asent: But what have I done with my life?\n","Processing asent: thought Mrs. Ramsay, taking her place at the head of the table, and looking at all the plates making white circles on it.\n","Processing asent: \"William, sit by me,\" she said.\n","Processing asent: \"Lily,\" she said, wearily, \"over there.\"\n","Processing asent: They had thatPaul Rayley and Minta Doyleshe, only thisan infinitely long table and plates and knives.\n","Processing asent: At the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a heap, frowning.\n","Processing asent: What at?\n","Processing asent: She did not know.\n","Processing asent: She did not mind.\n","Processing asent: She could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him.\n","Processing asent: She had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddythere and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of it.\n","Processing asent: It's all come to an end, she thought, while they came in one after another, Charles Tansley\"Sit there, please,\" she saidAugustus Carmichaeland sat down.\n","Processing asent: And meanwhile she waited, passively, for some one to answer her, for something to happen.\n","Processing asent: But this is not a thing, she thought, ladling out soup, that one says.\n","Processing asent: Raising her eyebrows at the discrepancythat was what she was thinking, this was what she was doingladling out soupshe felt, more and more strongly, outside that eddy; or as if a shade had fallen, and, robbed of colour, she saw things truly.\n","Processing asent: The room (she looked round it) was very shabby.\n","Processing asent: There was no beauty anywhere.\n","Processing asent: She forebore to look at Mr. Tansley.\n","Processing asent: Nothing seemed to have merged.\n","Processing asent: They all sat separate.\n","Processing asent: And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her.\n","Processing asent: Again she felt, as a fact without hostility, the sterility of men, for if she did not do it nobody would do it, and so, giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped, the old familiar pulse began beating, as the watch begins tickingone, two, three, one, two, three.\n","Processing asent: And so on and so on, she repeated, listening to it, sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news-paper.\n","Processing asent: And so then, she concluded, addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to William Bankespoor man! who had no wife, and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea.\n","Processing asent: \"Did you find your letters? I told them to put them in the hall for you,\" she said to William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: Lily Briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon.\n","Processing asent: How old she looks, how worn she looks, Lily thought, and how remote.\n","Processing asent: Then when she turned to William Bankes, smiling, it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again, and Lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved, Why does she pity him?\n","Processing asent: For that was the impression she gave, when she told him that his letters were in the hall.\n","Processing asent: Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be saying, as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people, and the life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity.\n","Processing asent: And it was not true, Lily thought; it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people's.\n","Processing asent: He is not in the least pitiable.\n","Processing asent: He has his work, Lily said to herself.\n","Processing asent: She remembered, all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure, that she had her work.\n","Processing asent: In a flash she saw her picture, and thought, Yes, I shall put the tree further in the middle; then I shall avoid that awkward space.\n","Processing asent: That's what I shall do.\n","Processing asent: That's what has been puzzling me.\n","Processing asent: She took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table-cloth, so as to remind herself to move the tree.\n","Processing asent: \"It's odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post, yet one always wants one's letters,\" said Mr. Bankes.\n","Processing asent: What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if, Lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals.\n","Processing asent: Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare unloveliness.\n","Processing asent: But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them.\n","Processing asent: She liked his eyes; they were blue, deep set, frightening.\n","Processing asent: \"Do you write many letters, Mr. Tansley?\" asked Mrs. Ramsay, pitying him too, Lily supposed; for that was true of Mrs. Ramsayshe pitied men always as if they lacked somethingwomen never, as if they had something.\n","Processing asent: He wrote to his mother; otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month, said Mr. Tansley, shortly.\n","Processing asent: For he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women.\n","Processing asent: He had been reading in his room, and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy.\n","Processing asent: Why did they dress?\n","Processing asent: He had come down in his ordinary clothes.\n","Processing asent: He had not got any dress clothes.\n","Processing asent: \"One never gets anything worth having by post\"that was the sort of thing they were always saying.\n","Processing asent: They made men say that sort of thing.\n","Processing asent: Yes, it was pretty well true, he thought.\n","Processing asent: They never got anything worth having from one year's end to another.\n","Processing asent: They did nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat, eat.\n","Processing asent: It was the women's fault.\n","Processing asent: Women made civilisation impossible with all their \"charm,\" all their silliness.\n","Processing asent: \"No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs. Ramsay,\" he said, asserting himself.\n","Processing asent: He liked her; he admired her; he still thought of the man in the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it necessary to assert himself.\n","Processing asent: He was really, Lily Briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but then look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human being she had ever met.\n","Processing asent: Then why did she mind what he said?\n","Processing asent: Women can't write, women can't paintwhat did that matter coming from him, since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him, and that was why he said it?\n","Processing asent: Why did her whole being bow, like corn under a wind, and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort?\n","Processing asent: She must make it once more.\n","Processing asent: There's the sprig on the table-cloth; there's my painting; I must move the tree to the middle; that mattersnothing else.\n","Processing asent: Could she not hold fast to that, she asked herself, and not lose her temper, and not argue; and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him?\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, Mr. Tansley,\" she said, \"do take me to the Lighthouse with you. I should so love it.\"\n","Processing asent: She was telling lies he could see.\n","Processing asent: She was saying what she did not mean to annoy him, for some reason.\n","Processing asent: She was laughing at him.\n","Processing asent: He was in his old flannel trousers.\n","Processing asent: He had no others.\n","Processing asent: He felt very rough and isolated and lonely.\n","Processing asent: He knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason; she didn't want to go to the Lighthouse with him; she despised him: so did Prue Ramsay; so did they all.\n","Processing asent: But he was not going to be made a fool of by women, so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said, all in a jerk, very rudely, it would be too rough for her tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: She would be sick.\n","Processing asent: It annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that, with Mrs. Ramsay listening.\n","Processing asent: If only he could be alone in his room working, he thought, among his books.\n","Processing asent: That was where he felt at his ease.\n","Processing asent: And he had never run a penny into debt; he had never cost his father a penny since he was fifteen; he had helped them at home out of his savings; he was educating his sister.\n","Processing asent: Still, he wished he had known how to answer Miss Briscoe properly; he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like that.\n","Processing asent: \"You'd be sick.\"\n","Processing asent: He wished he could think of something to say to Mrs. Ramsay, something which would show her that he was not just a dry prig.\n","Processing asent: That was what they all thought him.\n","Processing asent: He turned to her.\n","Processing asent: But Mrs. Ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: \"Yes, take it away,\" she said briefly, interrupting what she was saying to William Bankes to speak to the maid.\n","Processing asent: \"It must have been fifteen no, twenty years agothat I last saw her,\" she was saying, turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for she was absorbed by what they were saying.\n","Processing asent: So he had actually heard from her this evening!\n","Processing asent: And was Carrie still living at Marlow, and was everything still the same?\n","Processing asent: Oh, she could remember it as if it were yesterdayon the river, feeling it as if it were yesterdaygoing on the river, feeling very cold.\n","Processing asent: But if the Mannings made a plan they stuck to it.\n","Processing asent: Never should she forget Herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank!\n","Processing asent: And it was still going on, Mrs. Ramsay mused, gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing-room on the banks of the Thames where she had been so very, very cold twenty years ago; but now she went among them like a ghost; and it fascinated her, as if, while she had changed, that particular day, now become very still and beautiful, had remained there, all these years.\n","Processing asent: Had Carrie written to him herself?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: \"Yes. She says they're building a new billiard room,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: That was out of the question!\n","Processing asent: Building a new billiard room!\n","Processing asent: It seemed to her impossible.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it.\n","Processing asent: They were very well off now.\n","Processing asent: Should he give her love to Carrie?\n","Processing asent: \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Ramsay with a little start, \"No,\" she added, reflecting that she did not know this Carrie who built a new billiard room.\n","Processing asent: But how strange, she repeated, to Mr. Bankes's amusement, that they should be going on there still.\n","Processing asent: For it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time.\n","Processing asent: How eventful her own life had been, during those same years.\n","Processing asent: Yet perhaps Carrie Manning had not thought about her, either.\n","Processing asent: The thought was strange and distasteful.\n","Processing asent: \"People soon drift apart,\" said Mr. Bankes, feeling, however, some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the Mannings and the Ramsays.\n","Processing asent: He had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously.\n","Processing asent: But perhaps he was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into a groove.\n","Processing asent: He had friends in all circles...Mrs.\n","Processing asent: Ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot.\n","Processing asent: That was why he preferred dining alone.\n","Processing asent: All those interruptions annoyed him.\n","Processing asent: Well, thought William Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's friends ask of one.\n","Processing asent: It would have hurt her if he had refused to come.\n","Processing asent: But it was not worth it for him.\n","Processing asent: Looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would have been free to work.\n","Processing asent: Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time.\n","Processing asent: The children were dropping in still.\n","Processing asent: \"I wish one of you would run up to Roger's room,\" Mrs. Ramsay was saying.\n","Processing asent: How trifling it all is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other thing work.\n","Processing asent: Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he might have beenhe took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work.\n","Processing asent: What a waste of time it all was to be sure!\n","Processing asent: Yet, he thought, she is one of my oldest friends.\n","Processing asent: I am by way of being devoted to her.\n","Processing asent: Yet now, at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy at the window nothing, nothing.\n","Processing asent: He wished only to be alone and to take up that book.\n","Processing asent: He felt uncomfortable; he felt treacherous, that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her.\n","Processing asent: The truth was that he did not enjoy family life.\n","Processing asent: It was in this sort of state that one asked oneself, What does one live for?\n","Processing asent: Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these pains for the human race to go on?\n","Processing asent: Is it so very desirable?\n","Processing asent: Are we attractive as a species?\n","Processing asent: Not so very, he thought, looking at those rather untidy boys.\n","Processing asent: His favourite, Cam, was in bed, he supposed.\n","Processing asent: Foolish questions, vain questions, questions one never asked if one was occupied.\n","Processing asent: Is human life this?\n","Processing asent: Is human life that?\n","Processing asent: One never had time to think about it.\n","Processing asent: But here he was asking himself that sort of question, because Mrs. Ramsay was giving orders to servants, and also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised Mrs. Ramsay was that Carrie Manning should still exist, that friendships, even the best of them, are frail things.\n","Processing asent: One drifts apart.\n","Processing asent: He reproached himself again.\n","Processing asent: He was sitting beside Mrs. Ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her.\n","Processing asent: \"I'm so sorry,\" said Mrs. Ramsy, turning to him at last.\n","Processing asent: He felt rigid and barren, like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them.\n","Processing asent: Yet he must force his feet into them.\n","Processing asent: He must make himself talk.\n","Processing asent: Unless he were very careful, she would find out this treachery of his; that he did not care a straw for her, and that would not be at all pleasant, he thought.\n","Processing asent: So he bent his head courteously in her direction.\n","Processing asent: \"How you must detest dining in this bear garden,\" she said, making use, as she did when she was distracted, of her social manner.\n","Processing asent: So, when there is a strife of tongues, at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that every one shall speak in French.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps it is bad French; French may not contain the words that express the speaker's thoughts; nevertheless speaking French imposes some order, some uniformity.\n","Processing asent: Replying to her in the same language, Mr. Bankes said, \"No, not at all,\" and Mr. Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language, even spoke thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its insincerity.\n","Processing asent: They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends.\n","Processing asent: There, in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe \"staying with the Ramsays\" and what nonsense they talked.\n","Processing asent: It was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again.\n","Processing asent: The women bored one so, he would say.\n","Processing asent: Of course Ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children.\n","Processing asent: It would shape itself something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him, nothing had shaped itself at all.\n","Processing asent: It was all in scraps and fragments.\n","Processing asent: He felt extremely, even physically, uncomfortable.\n","Processing asent: He wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself.\n","Processing asent: He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again.\n","Processing asent: They were talking about the fishing industry.\n","Processing asent: Why did no one ask him his opinion?\n","Processing asent: What did they know about the fishing industry?\n","Processing asent: Lily Briscoe knew all that.\n","Processing asent: Sitting opposite him, could she not see, as in an X-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the young man's desire to impress himself, lying dark in the mist of his fleshthat thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation?\n","Processing asent: But, she thought, screwing up her Chinese eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women, \"can't paint, can't write,\" why should I help him to relieve himself?\n","Processing asent: There is a code of behaviour, she knew, whose seventh article (it may be) says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman, whatever her own occupation might be, to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones, the ribs, of his vanity, of his urgent desire to assert himself; as indeed it is their duty, she reflected, in her old maidenly fairness, to help us, suppose the Tube were to burst into flames.\n","Processing asent: Then, she thought, I should certainly expect Mr. Tansley to get me out.\n","Processing asent: But how would it be, she thought, if neither of us did either of these things?\n","Processing asent: So she sat there smiling.\n","Processing asent: \"You're not planning to go to the Lighthouse, are you, Lily,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Remember poor Mr. Langley; he had been round the world dozens of times, but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband took him there. Are you a good sailor, Mr. Tansley?\" she asked.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Tansley raised a hammer: swung it high in air; but realising, as it descended, that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this, said only that he had never been sick in his life.\n","Processing asent: But in that one sentence lay compact, like gunpowder, that his grandfather was a fisherman; his father a chemist; that he had worked his way up entirely himself; that he was proud of it; that he was Charles Tansleya fact that nobody there seemed to realise; but one of these days every single person would know it.\n","Processing asent: He scowled ahead of him.\n","Processing asent: He could almost pity these mild cultivated people, who would be blown sky high, like bales of wool and barrels of apples, one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him.\n","Processing asent: \"Will you take me, Mr. Tansley?\" said Lily, quickly, kindly, for, of course, if Mrs. Ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, \"I am drowning, my dear, in seas of fire. Unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there, life will run upon the rocksindeed I hear the grating and the growling at this minute. My nerves are taut as fiddle strings. Another touch and they will snap\"when Mrs. Ramsay said all this, as the glance in her eyes said it, of course for the hundred and fiftieth time Lily Briscoe had to renounce the experimentwhat happens if one is not nice to that young man thereand be nice.\n","Processing asent: Judging the turn in her mood correctlythat she was friendly to him nowhe was relieved of his egotism, and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby; how his father used to fish him out with a boat-hook; that was how he had learnt to swim.\n","Processing asent: One of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the Scottish coast, he said.\n","Processing asent: He had been there with him in a storm.\n","Processing asent: This was said loudly in a pause.\n","Processing asent: They had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm.\n","Processing asent: Ah, thought Lily Briscoe, as the conversation took this auspicious turn, and she felt Mrs. Ramsay's gratitude (for Mrs. Ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself), ah, she thought, but what haven't I paid to get it for you?\n","Processing asent: She had not been sincere.\n","Processing asent: She had done the usual trickbeen nice.\n","Processing asent: She would never know him.\n","Processing asent: He would never know her.\n","Processing asent: Human relations were all like that, she thought, and the worst (if it had not been for Mr. Bankes) were between men and women.\n","Processing asent: Inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought.\n","Processing asent: Then her eye caught the salt cellar, which she had placed there to remind her, and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle, and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what Mr. Tansley was saying.\n","Processing asent: Let him talk all night if he liked it.\n","Processing asent: \"But how long do they leave men on a Lighthouse?\" she asked.\n","Processing asent: He told her.\n","Processing asent: He was amazingly well informed.\n","Processing asent: And as he was grateful, and as he liked her, and as he was beginning to enjoy himself, so now, Mrs. Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that unreal but fascinating place, the Mannings' drawing-room at Marlow twenty years ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety, for there was no future to worry about.\n","Processing asent: She knew what had happened to them, what to her.\n","Processing asent: It was like reading a good book again, for she knew the end of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which shot down even from this dining-room table in cascades, heaven knows where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a lake, placidly between its banks.\n","Processing asent: He said they had built a billiard roomwas it possible?\n","Processing asent: Would William go on talking about the Mannings?\n","Processing asent: She wanted him to.\n","Processing asent: But, nofor some reason he was no longer in the mood.\n","Processing asent: She tried.\n","Processing asent: He did not respond.\n","Processing asent: She could not force him.\n","Processing asent: She was disappointed.\n","Processing asent: \"The children are disgraceful,\" she said, sighing.\n","Processing asent: He said something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not acquire until later in life.\n","Processing asent: \"If at all,\" said Mrs. Ramsay merely to fill up space, thinking what an old maid William was becoming.\n","Processing asent: Conscious of his treachery, conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate, yet out of mood for it at present, he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life, sitting there, waiting.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps the others were saying something interesting?\n","Processing asent: What were they saying?\n","Processing asent: That the fishing season was bad; that the men were emigrating.\n","Processing asent: They were talking about wages and unemployment.\n","Processing asent: The young man was abusing the government.\n","Processing asent: William Bankes, thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable, heard him say something about \"one of the most scandalous acts of the present government.\"\n","Processing asent: Lily was listening; Mrs. Ramsay was listening; they were all listening.\n","Processing asent: But already bored, Lily felt that something was lacking; Mr. Bankes felt that something was lacking.\n","Processing asent: Pulling her shawl round her Mrs. Ramsay felt that something was lacking.\n","Processing asent: All of them bending themselves to listen thought, \"Pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed,\" for each thought, \"The others are feeling this. They are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen. Whereas, I feel nothing at all.\"\n","Processing asent: But perhaps, thought Mr. Bankes, as he looked at Mr. Tansley, here is the man.\n","Processing asent: One was always waiting for the man.\n","Processing asent: There was always a chance.\n","Processing asent: At any moment the leader might arise; the man of genius, in politics as in anything else.\n","Processing asent: Probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies, thought Mr. Bankes, doing his best to make allowances, for he knew by some curious physical sensation, as of nerves erect in his spine, that he was jealous, for himself partly, partly more probably for his work, for his point of view, for his science; and therefore he was not entirely open- minded or altogether fair, for Mr. Tansley seemed to be saying, You have wasted your lives.\n","Processing asent: You are all of you wrong.\n","Processing asent: Poor old fogies, you're hopelessly behind the times.\n","Processing asent: He seemed to be rather cocksure, this young man; and his manners were bad.\n","Processing asent: But Mr. Bankes bade himself observe, he had courage; he had ability; he was extremely well up in the facts.\n","Processing asent: Probably, Mr. Bankes thought, as Tansley abused the government, there is a good deal in what he says.\n","Processing asent: \"Tell me now...\" he said.\n","Processing asent: So they argued about politics, and Lily looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and Mrs. Ramsay, leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was so bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the other end of the table, that he would say something.\n","Processing asent: One word, she said to herself.\n","Processing asent: For if he said a thing, it would make all the difference.\n","Processing asent: He went to the heart of things.\n","Processing asent: He cared about fishermen and their wages.\n","Processing asent: He could not sleep for thinking of them.\n","Processing asent: It was altogether different when he spoke; one did not feel then, pray heaven you don't see how little I care, because one did care.\n","Processing asent: Then, realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak, she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage, and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him.\n","Processing asent: She looked at him thinking to find this in his face; he would be looking magnificent...But not in the least!\n","Processing asent: He was screwing his face up, he was scowling and frowning, and flushing with anger.\n","Processing asent: What on earth was it about?\n","Processing asent: she wondered.\n","Processing asent: What could be the matter?\n","Processing asent: Only that poor old Augustus had asked for another plate of soupthat was all.\n","Processing asent: It was unthinkable, it was detestable (so he signalled to her across the table) that Augustus should be beginning his soup over again.\n","Processing asent: He loathed people eating when he had finished.\n","Processing asent: She saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes, his brow, and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode, and thenthank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words.\n","Processing asent: He sat there scowling.\n","Processing asent: He had said nothing, he would have her observe.\n","Processing asent: Let her give him the credit for that!\n","Processing asent: But why after all should poor Augustus not ask for another plate of soup?\n","Processing asent: He had merely touched Ellen's arm and said:\n","Processing asent: \"Ellen, please, another plate of soup,\" and then Mr. Ramsay scowled like that.\n","Processing asent: And why not?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay demanded.\n","Processing asent: Surely they could let Augustus have his soup if he wanted it.\n","Processing asent: He hated people wallowing in food, Mr. Ramsay frowned at her.\n","Processing asent: He hated everything dragging on for hours like this.\n","Processing asent: But he had controlled himself, Mr. Ramsay would have her observe, disgusting though the sight was.\n","Processing asent: But why show it so plainly, Mrs. Ramsay demanded (they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what the other felt).\n","Processing asent: Everybody could see, Mrs. Ramsay thought.\n","Processing asent: There was Rose gazing at her father, there was Roger gazing at his father; both would be off in spasms of laughter in another second, she knew, and so she said promptly (indeed it was time):\n","Processing asent: \"Light the candles,\" and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled at the sideboard.\n","Processing asent: Why could he never conceal his feelings?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay wondered, and she wondered if Augustus Carmichael had noticed.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps he had; perhaps he had not.\n","Processing asent: She could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there, drinking his soup.\n","Processing asent: If he wanted soup, he asked for soup.\n","Processing asent: Whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same.\n","Processing asent: He did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she wondered what he did feel then, and why he was always content and dignified; and she thought how devoted he was to Andrew, and would call him into his room, and Andrew said, \"show him things.\"\n","Processing asent: And there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he reminded one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word, and her husband said, \"Poor old Augustushe's a true poet,\" which was high praise from her husband.\n","Processing asent: Now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit.\n","Processing asent: What had she done with it, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, for Rose's arrangement of the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined shell, of the bananas, made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea, of Neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of Bacchus (in some picture), among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold...Thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth, was like a world in which one could take one's staff and climb hills, she thought, and go down into valleys, and to her pleasure (for it brought them into sympathy momentarily) she saw that Augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit, plunged in, broke off a bloom there, a tassel here, and returned, after feasting, to his hive.\n","Processing asent: That was his way of looking, different from hers.\n","Processing asent: But looking together united them.\n","Processing asent: Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the night was now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and vanished, waterily.\n","Processing asent: Some change at once went through them all, as if this had really happened, and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow, on an island; had their common cause against that fluidity out there.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay, who had been uneasy, waiting for Paul and Minta to come in, and unable, she felt, to settle to things, now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation.\n","Processing asent: For now they must come, and Lily Briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration, compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by candlelight.\n","Processing asent: Some weight was taken off them; anything might happen, she felt.\n","Processing asent: They must come now, Mrs. Ramsay thought, looking at the door, and at that instant, Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together.\n","Processing asent: They were awfully late; they were horribly late, Minta said, as they found their way to different ends of the table.\n","Processing asent: \"I lost my broochmy grandmother's brooch,\" said Minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes, looking down, looking up, as she sat by Mr. Ramsay, which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her.\n","Processing asent: How could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble about the rocks in jewels?\n","Processing asent: She was by way of being terrified of himhe was so fearfully clever, and the first night when she had sat by him, and he talked about George Eliot, she had been really frightened, for she had left the third volume of MIDDLEMARCH in the train and she never knew what happened in the end; but afterwards she got on perfectly, and made herself out even more ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a fool.\n","Processing asent: And so tonight, directly he laughed at her, she was not frightened.\n","Processing asent: Besides, she knew, directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened; she wore her golden haze.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes she had it; sometimes not.\n","Processing asent: She never knew why it came or why it went, or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her.\n","Processing asent: Yes, tonight she had it, tremendously; she knew that by the way Mr. Ramsay told her not to be a fool.\n","Processing asent: She sat beside him, smiling.\n","Processing asent: It must have happened then, thought Mrs. Ramsay; they are engaged.\n","Processing asent: And for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again jealousy.\n","Processing asent: For he, her husband, felt it tooMinta's glow; he liked these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with something flying, something a little wild and harum-scarum about them, who didn't \"scrape their hair off,\" weren't, as he said about poor Lily Briscoe, \"skimpy\".\n","Processing asent: There was some quality which she herself had not, some lustre, some richness, which attracted him, amused him, led him to make favourites of girls like Minta.\n","Processing asent: They might cut his hair from him, plait him watch-chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him (she heard them), \"Come along, Mr. Ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now,\" and out he came to play tennis.\n","Processing asent: But indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she made herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she had grown old, perhaps, by her own fault.\n","Processing asent: (The bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it.)\n","Processing asent: She was grateful to them for laughing at him.\n","Processing asent: (\"How many pipes have you smoked today, Mr. Ramsay?\" and so on), till he seemed a young man; a man very attractive to women, not burdened, not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure, but again as she had first known him, gaunt but gallant; helping her out of a boat, she remembered; with delightful ways, like that (she looked at him, and he looked astonishingly young, teasing Minta).\n","Processing asent: For herself\"Put it down there,\" she said, helping the Swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the BOEUF EN DAUBEfor her own part, she liked her boobies.\n","Processing asent: Paul must sit by her.\n","Processing asent: She had kept a place for him.\n","Processing asent: Really, she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best.\n","Processing asent: They did not bother one with their dissertations.\n","Processing asent: How much they missed, after all, these very clever men!\n","Processing asent: How dried up they did become, to be sure.\n","Processing asent: There was something, she thought as he sat down, very charming about Paul.\n","Processing asent: His manners were delightful to her, and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes.\n","Processing asent: He was so considerate.\n","Processing asent: Would he tell hernow that they were all talking againwhat had happened?\n","Processing asent: \"We went back to look for Minta's brooch,\" he said, sitting down by her.\n","Processing asent: \"We\"that was enough.\n","Processing asent: She knew from the effort, the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said \"we.\" \"We did this, we did that.\"\n","Processing asent: They'll say that all their lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as Marthe, with a little flourish, took the cover off.\n","Processing asent: The cook had spent three days over that dish.\n","Processing asent: And she must take great care, Mrs. Ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to choose a specially tender piece for William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: And she peered into the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine, and thought, This will celebrate the occasiona curious sense rising in her, at once freakish and tender, of celebrating a festival, as if two emotions were called up in her, one profoundfor what could be more serious than the love of man for woman, what more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its bosom the seeds of death; at the same time these lovers, these people entering into illusion glittering eyed, must be danced round with mockery, decorated with garlands.\n","Processing asent: \"It is a triumph,\" said Mr. Bankes, laying his knife down for a moment.\n","Processing asent: He had eaten attentively.\n","Processing asent: It was rich; it was tender.\n","Processing asent: It was perfectly cooked.\n","Processing asent: How did she manage these things in the depths of the country?\n","Processing asent: he asked her.\n","Processing asent: She was a wonderful woman.\n","Processing asent: All his love, all his reverence, had returned; and she knew it.\n","Processing asent: \"It is a French recipe of my grandmother's,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice.\n","Processing asent: Of course it was French.\n","Processing asent: What passes for cookery in England is an abomination (they agreed).\n","Processing asent: It is putting cabbages in water.\n","Processing asent: It is roasting meat till it is like leather.\n","Processing asent: It is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables.\n","Processing asent: \"In which,\" said Mr. Bankes, \"all the virtue of the vegetable is contained.\"\n","Processing asent: And the waste, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: A whole French family could live on what an English cook throws away.\n","Processing asent: Spurred on by her sense that William's affection had come back to her, and that everything was all right again, and that her suspense was over, and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock, she laughed, she gesticulated, till Lily thought, How childlike, how absurd she was, sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her, talking about the skins of vegetables.\n","Processing asent: There was something frightening about her.\n","Processing asent: She was irresistible.\n","Processing asent: Always she got her own way in the end, Lily thought.\n","Processing asent: Now she had brought this offPaul and Minta, one might suppose, were engaged.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Bankes was dining here.\n","Processing asent: She put a spell on them all, by wishing, so simply, so directly, and Lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her face was all lit upwithout looking young, she looked radiant) in this strange, this terrifying thing, which made Paul Rayley, sitting at her side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay, Lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that, worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it, and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims, Lily felt, to the altar.\n","Processing asent: It came over her too nowthe emotion, the vibration, of love.\n","Processing asent: How inconspicuous she felt herself by Paul's side!\n","Processing asent: He, glowing, burning; she, aloof, satirical; he, bound for adventure; she, moored to the shore; he, launched, incautious; she solitary, left outand, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in his disaster, she said shyly:\n","Processing asent: \"When did Minta lose her brooch?\"\n","Processing asent: He smiled the most exquisite smile, veiled by memory, tinged by dreams.\n","Processing asent: He shook his head.\n","Processing asent: \"On the beach,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: \"I'm going to find it,\" he said, \"I'm getting up early.\"\n","Processing asent: This being kept secret from Minta, he lowered his voice, and turned his eyes to where she sat, laughing, beside Mr. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: Lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half-hidden by some stone, and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers.\n","Processing asent: But what did he reply to her offer?\n","Processing asent: She actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear, \"Let me come with you,\" and he laughed.\n","Processing asent: He meant yes or no either perhaps.\n","Processing asent: But it was not his meaningit was the odd chuckle he gave, as if he had said, Throw yourself over the cliff if you like, I don't care.\n","Processing asent: He turned on her cheek the heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its unscrupulosity.\n","Processing asent: It scorched her, and Lily, looking at Minta, being charming to Mr. Ramsay at the other end of the table, flinched for her exposed to these fangs, and was thankful.\n","Processing asent: For at any rate, she said to herself, catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern, she need not marry, thank Heaven: she need not undergo that degradation.\n","Processing asent: She was saved from that dilution.\n","Processing asent: She would move the tree rather more to the middle.\n","Processing asent: Such was the complexity of things.\n","Processing asent: For what happened to her, especially staying with the Ramsays, was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time; that's what you feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the other, and then they fought together in her mind, as now.\n","Processing asent: It is so beautiful, so exciting, this love, that I tremble on the verge of it, and offer, quite out of my own habit, to look for a brooch on a beach; also it is the stupidest, the most barbaric of human passions, and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite) into a bully with a crowbar (he was swaggering, he was insolent) in the Mile End Road.\n","Processing asent: Yet, she said to herself, from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love; wreaths heaped and roses; and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but thislove; while the women, judging from her own experience, would all the time be feeling, This is not what we want; there is nothing more tedious, puerile, and inhumane than this; yet it is also beautiful and necessary.\n","Processing asent: Well then, well then?\n","Processing asent: she asked, somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if in an argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on.\n","Processing asent: So she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love.\n","Processing asent: \"Then,\" said Mr. Bankes, \"there is that liquid the English call coffee.\"\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, coffee!\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: But it was much rather a question (she was thoroughly roused, Lily could see, and talked very emphatically) of real butter and clean milk.\n","Processing asent: Speaking with warmth and eloquence, she described the iniquity of the English dairy system, and in what state milk was delivered at the door, and was about to prove her charges, for she had gone into the matter, when all round the table, beginning with Andrew in the middle, like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze, her children laughed; her husband laughed; she was laughed at, fire- encircled, and forced to veil her crest, dismount her batteries, and only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to Mr. Bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the British Public.\n","Processing asent: Purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that Lily, who had helped her with Mr. Tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from the rest; said \"Lily anyhow agrees with me,\" and so drew her in, a little fluttered, a little startled.\n","Processing asent: (For she was thinking about love.)\n","Processing asent: They were both out of things, Mrs. Ramsay had been thinking, both Lily and Charles Tansley.\n","Processing asent: Both suffered from the glow of the other two.\n","Processing asent: He, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no woman would look at him with Paul Rayley in the room.\n","Processing asent: Poor fellow!\n","Processing asent: Still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon something: he could take care of himself.\n","Processing asent: With Lily it was different.\n","Processing asent: She faded, under Minta's glow; became more inconspicuous than ever, in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little Chinese eyes.\n","Processing asent: Everything about her was so small.\n","Processing asent: Yet, thought Mrs. Ramsay, comparing her with Minta, as she claimed her help (for Lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his bootshe would talk by the hour about his boots) of the two, Lily at forty will be the better.\n","Processing asent: There was in Lily a thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which Mrs. Ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared.\n","Processing asent: Obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: But then he cared, well, Mrs. Ramsay sometimes thought that he cared, since his wife's death, perhaps for her.\n","Processing asent: He was not \"in love\" of course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many.\n","Processing asent: Oh, but nonsense, she thought; William must marry Lily.\n","Processing asent: They have so many things in common.\n","Processing asent: Lily is so fond of flowers.\n","Processing asent: They are both cold and aloof and rather self-sufficing.\n","Processing asent: She must arrange for them to take a long walk together.\n","Processing asent: Foolishly, she had set them opposite each other.\n","Processing asent: That could be remedied tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: If it were fine, they should go for a picnic.\n","Processing asent: Everything seemed possible.\n","Processing asent: Everything seemed right.\n","Processing asent: Just now (but this cannot last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots) just now she had reached security; she hovered like a hawk suspended; like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly rather, for it arose, she thought, looking at them all eating there, from husband and children and friends; all of which rising in this profound stillness (she was helping William Bankes to one very small piece more, and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot) seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke, like a fume rising upwards, holding them safe together.\n","Processing asent: Nothing need be said; nothing could be said.\n","Processing asent: There it was, all round them.\n","Processing asent: It partook, she felt, carefully helping Mr. Bankes to a specially tender piece, of eternity; as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon; there is a coherence in things, a stability; something, she meant, is immune from change, and shines out (she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights) in the face of the flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby; so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today, already, of peace, of rest.\n","Processing asent: Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures.\n","Processing asent: \"Yes,\" she assured William Bankes, \"there is plenty for everybody.\"\n","Processing asent: \"Andrew,\" she said, \"hold your plate lower, or I shall spill it.\" (The BOEUF EN DAUBE was a perfect triumph.) Here, she felt, putting the spoon down, where one could move or rest; could wait now (they were all helped) listening; could then, like a hawk which lapses suddenly from its high station, flaunt and sink on laughter easily, resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty-three.\n","Processing asent: That was the number, it seemed, on his watch.\n","Processing asent: What did it all mean?\n","Processing asent: To this day she had no notion.\n","Processing asent: A square root?\n","Processing asent: What was that?\n","Processing asent: Her sons knew.\n","Processing asent: She leant on them; on cubes and square roots; that was what they were talking about now; on Voltaire and Madame de Stael; on the character of Napoleon; on the French system of land tenure; on Lord Rosebery; on Creevey's Memoirs: she let it uphold her and sustain her, this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence, which ran up and down, crossed this way and that, like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree.\n","Processing asent: Then she woke up.\n","Processing asent: It was still being fabricated.\n","Processing asent: William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.\n","Processing asent: He read one of them every six months, he said.\n","Processing asent: And why should that make Charles Tansley angry?\n","Processing asent: He rushed in (all, thought Mrs. Ramsay, because Prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the Waverly novels when he knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, Mrs. Ramsay thought, observing him rather than listening to what he said.\n","Processing asent: She could see how it was from his mannerhe wanted to assert himself, and so it would always be with him till he got his Professorship or married his wife, and so need not be always saying, \"III.\"\n","Processing asent: For that was what his criticism of poor Sir Walter, or perhaps it was Jane Austen, amounted to.\n","Processing asent: \"I-I-I.\"\n","Processing asent: He was thinking of himself and the impression he was making, as she could tell by the sound of his voice, and his emphasis and his uneasiness.\n","Processing asent: Success would be good for him.\n","Processing asent: At any rate they were off again.\n","Processing asent: Now she need not listen.\n","Processing asent: It could not last, she knew, but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves, and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging, trembling.\n","Processing asent: So she saw them; she heard them; but whatever they said had also this quality, as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when, at the same time, one can see the ripple and the gravel, something to the right, something to the left; and the whole is held together; for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another; she would be saying she liked the Waverly novels or had not read them; she would be urging herself forward; now she said nothing.\n","Processing asent: For the moment, she hung suspended.\n","Processing asent: \"Ah, but how long do you think it'll last?\" said somebody.\n","Processing asent: It was as if she had antennae trembling out from her, which, intercepting certain sentences, forced them upon her attention.\n","Processing asent: This was one of them.\n","Processing asent: She scented danger for her husband.\n","Processing asent: A question like that would lead, almost certainly, to something being said which reminded him of his own failure.\n","Processing asent: How long would he be readhe would think at once.\n","Processing asent: William Bankes (who was entirely free from all such vanity) laughed, and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion.\n","Processing asent: Who could tell what was going to lastin literature or indeed in anything else?\n","Processing asent: \"Let us enjoy what we do enjoy,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: His integrity seemed to Mrs. Ramsay quite admirable.\n","Processing asent: He never seemed for a moment to think, But how does this affect me?\n","Processing asent: But then if you had the other temperament, which must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began (and she knew that Mr. Ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want somebody to say, Oh, but your work will last, Mr. Ramsay, or something like that.\n","Processing asent: He showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with some irritation, that, anyhow, Scott (or was it Shakespeare ?) would last him his lifetime.\n","Processing asent: He said it irritably.\n","Processing asent: Everybody, she thought, felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why.\n","Processing asent: Then Minta Doyle, whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading Shakespeare.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people liked it as much as they said they did.\n","Processing asent: But, he added, there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and Mrs. Ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at Minta, and she, Mrs. Ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and praise him, somehow or other.\n","Processing asent: But she wished it was not necessary: perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary.\n","Processing asent: Anyhow, she was free now to listen to what Paul Rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy.\n","Processing asent: They lasted, he said.\n","Processing asent: He had read some of Tolstoi at school.\n","Processing asent: There was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the name.\n","Processing asent: Russian names were impossible, said Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: \"Vronsky,\" said Paul.\n","Processing asent: He remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain.\n","Processing asent: \"Vronsky,\" said Mrs. Ramsay; \"Oh, ANNA KARENINA,\" but that did not take them very far; books were not in their line.\n","Processing asent: No, Charles Tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but it was all so mixed up with, Am I saying the right thing?\n","Processing asent: Am I making a good impression?\n","Processing asent: that, after all, one knew more about him than about Tolstoi, whereas, what Paul said was about the thing, simply, not himself, nothing else.\n","Processing asent: Like all stupid people, he had a kind of modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, once in a way at least, she found attractive.\n","Processing asent: Now he was thinking, not about himself, or about Tolstoi, but whether she was cold, whether she felt a draught, whether she would like a pear.\n","Processing asent: No, she said, she did not want a pear.\n","Processing asent: Indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit (without realising it) jealously, hoping that nobody would touch it.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit, among the rich purples of the lowland grapes, then over the horny ridge of the shell, putting a yellow against a purple, a curved shape against a round shape, without knowing why she did it, or why, every time she did it, she felt more and more serene; until, oh, what a pity that they should do ita hand reached out, took a pear, and spoilt the whole thing.\n","Processing asent: In sympathy she looked at Rose.\n","Processing asent: She looked at Rose sitting between Jasper and Prue.\n","Processing asent: How odd that one's child should do that!\n","Processing asent: How odd to see them sitting there, in a row, her children, Jasper, Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke of their own going on, she guessed, from the twitching at their lips.\n","Processing asent: It was something quite apart from everything else, something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room.\n","Processing asent: It was not about their father, she hoped.\n","Processing asent: No, she thought not.\n","Processing asent: What was it, she wondered, sadly rather, for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there.\n","Processing asent: There was all that hoarded behind those rather set, still, mask-like faces, for they did not join in easily; they were like watchers, surveyors, a little raised or set apart from the grown-up people.\n","Processing asent: But when she looked at Prue tonight, she saw that this was not now quite true of her.\n","Processing asent: She was just beginning, just moving, just descending.\n","Processing asent: The faintest light was on her face, as if the glow of Minta opposite, some excitement, some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her, as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table-cloth, and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it.\n","Processing asent: She kept looking at Minta, shyly, yet curiously, so that Mrs. Ramsay looked from one to the other and said, speaking to Prue in her own mind, You will be as happy as she is one of these days.\n","Processing asent: You will be much happier, she added, because you are my daughter, she meant; her own daughter must be happier than other people's daughters.\n","Processing asent: But dinner was over.\n","Processing asent: It was time to go.\n","Processing asent: They were only playing with things on their plates.\n","Processing asent: She would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling.\n","Processing asent: He was having a joke with Minta about a bet.\n","Processing asent: Then she would get up.\n","Processing asent: She liked Charles Tansley, she thought, suddenly; she liked his laugh.\n","Processing asent: She liked him for being so angry with Paul and Minta.\n","Processing asent: She liked his awkwardness.\n","Processing asent: There was a lot in that young man after all.\n","Processing asent: And Lily, she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she always has some joke of her own.\n","Processing asent: One need never bother about Lily.\n","Processing asent: She waited.\n","Processing asent: She tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate.\n","Processing asent: Well, were they done now?\n","Processing asent: That story had led to another story.\n","Processing asent: Her husband was in great spirits tonight, and wishing, she supposed, to make it all right with old Augustus after that scene about the soup, had drawn him in they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college.\n","Processing asent: She looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black, and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely, as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral, for she did not listen to the words.\n","Processing asent: The sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice (Minta's) speaking alone, reminded her of men and boys crying out the Latin words of a service in some Roman Catholic cathedral.\n","Processing asent: She waited.\n","Processing asent: Her husband spoke.\n","Processing asent: He was repeating something, and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation, and melancholy in his voice:\n","Processing asent: Come out and climb the garden path, Luriana Lurilee.\n","Processing asent: The China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee.\n","Processing asent: The words (she was looking at the window) sounded as if they were floating like flowers on water out there, cut off from them all, as if no one had said them, but they had come into existence of themselves.\n","Processing asent: And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be Are full of trees and changing leaves.\n","Processing asent: She did not know what they meant, but, like music, the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice, outside her self, saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things.\n","Processing asent: She knew, without looking round, that every one at the table was listening to the voice saying:\n","Processing asent: I wonder if it seems to you, Luriana, Lurilee\n","Processing asent: with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had, as if this were, at last, the natural thing to say, this were their own voice speaking.\n","Processing asent: But the voice had stopped.\n","Processing asent: She looked round.\n","Processing asent: She made herself get up.\n","Processing asent: Augustus Carmichael had risen and, holding his table napkin so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting:\n","Processing asent: To see the Kings go riding by Over lawn and daisy lea With their palm leaves and cedar Luriana, Lurilee,\n","Processing asent: and as she passed him, he turned slightly towards her repeating the last words:\n","Processing asent: Luriana, Lurilee\n","Processing asent: and bowed to her as if he did her homage.\n","Processing asent: Without knowing why, she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before; and with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through the door which he held open for her.\n","Processing asent: It was necessary now to carry everything a step further.\n","Processing asent: With her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and took Minta's arm and left the room, it changed, it shaped itself differently; it had become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already the past.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 18\n","Processing asent: As usual, Lily thought.\n","Processing asent: There was always something that had to be done at that precise moment, something that Mrs. Ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly, it might be with every one standing about making jokes, as now, not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking-room, into the drawing-room, up to the attics.\n","Processing asent: Then one saw Mrs. Ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with Minta's arm in hers, bethink her, \"Yes, it is time for that now,\" and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone.\n","Processing asent: And directly she went a sort of disintegration set in; they wavered about, went different ways, Mr. Bankes took Charles Tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening, making the weight fall in a different direction, as if, Lily thought, seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the policy of the Labour Party, they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings; the change from poetry to politics struck her like that; so Mr. Bankes and Charles Mrs. Ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone.\n","Processing asent: Where, Lily wondered, was she going so quickly?\n","Processing asent: Not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather slowly.\n","Processing asent: She felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the thing that mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before her, and bring it to the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave, sat the judges she had set up to decide these things.\n","Processing asent: Is it good, is it bad, is it right or wrong?\n","Processing asent: Where are we all going to?\n","Processing asent: and so on.\n","Processing asent: So she righted herself after the shock of the event, and quite unconsciously and incongruously, used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position.\n","Processing asent: Her world was changing: they were still.\n","Processing asent: The event had given her a sense of movement.\n","Processing asent: All must be in order.\n","Processing asent: She must get that right and that right, she thought, insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees' stillness, and now again of the superb upward rise (like the beak of a ship up a wave) of the elm branches as the wind raised them.\n","Processing asent: For it was windy (she stood a moment to look out).\n","Processing asent: It was windy, so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star, and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves.\n","Processing asent: Yes, that was done then, accomplished; and as with all things done, became solemn.\n","Processing asent: Now one thought of it, cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck everything into stability.\n","Processing asent: They would, she thought, going on again, however long they lived, come back to this night; this moon; this wind; this house: and to her too.\n","Processing asent: It flattered her, where she was most susceptible of flattery, to think how, wound about in their hearts, however long they lived she would be woven; and this, and this, and this, she thought, going upstairs, laughing, but affectionately, at the sofa on the landing (her mother's); at the rocking-chair (her father's); at the map of the Hebrides.\n","Processing asent: All that would be revived again in the lives of Paul and Minta; \"the Rayleys\"she tried the new name over; and she felt, with her hand on the nursery door, that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically (the feeling was one of relief and happiness) it was all one stream, and chairs, tables, maps, were hers, were theirs, it did not matter whose, and Paul and Minta would carry it on when she was dead.\n","Processing asent: She turned the handle, firmly, lest it should squeak, and went in, pursing her lips slightly, as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud.\n","Processing asent: But directly she came in she saw, with annoyance, that the precaution was not needed.\n","Processing asent: The children were not asleep.\n","Processing asent: It was most annoying.\n","Processing asent: Mildred should be more careful.\n","Processing asent: There was James wide awake and Cam sitting bolt upright, and Mildred out of bed in her bare feet, and it was almost eleven and they were all talking.\n","Processing asent: What was the matter?\n","Processing asent: It was that horrid skull again.\n","Processing asent: She had told Mildred to move it, but Mildred, of course, had forgotten, and now there was Cam wide awake, and James wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago.\n","Processing asent: What had possessed Edward to send them this horrid skull?\n","Processing asent: She had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there.\n","Processing asent: It was nailed fast, Mildred said, and Cam couldn't go to sleep with it in the room, and James screamed if she touched it.\n","Processing asent: Then Cam must go to sleep (it had great horns said Cam)must go to sleep and dream of lovely palaces, said Mrs. Ramsay, sitting down on the bed by her side.\n","Processing asent: She could see the horns, Cam said, all over the room.\n","Processing asent: It was true.\n","Processing asent: Wherever they put the light (and James could not sleep without a light) there was always a shadow somewhere.\n","Processing asent: \"But think, Cam, it's only an old pig,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, \"a nice black pig like the pigs at the farm.\"\n","Processing asent: But Cam thought it was a horrid thing, branching at her all over the room.\n","Processing asent: \"Well then,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, \"we will cover it up,\" and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers, and open the little drawers quickly one after another, and not seeing anything that would do, she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull, round and round and round, and then she came back to Cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside Cam's and said how lovely it looked now; how the fairies would love it; it was like a bird's nest; it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad, with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes and...She could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in Cam's mind, and Cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain, a bird's nest, a garden, and there were little antelopes, and her eyes were opening and shutting, and Mrs. Ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously, and more rhythmically and more nonsensically, how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens, and everything lovely, she said, raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically, until she sat upright and saw that Cam was asleep.\n","Processing asent: Now, she whispered, crossing over to his bed, James must go to sleep too, for see, she said, the boar's skull was still there; they had not touched it; they had done just what he wanted; it was there quite unhurt.\n","Processing asent: He made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl.\n","Processing asent: But he wanted to ask her something more.\n","Processing asent: Would they go to the Lighthouse tomorrow?\n","Processing asent: No, not tomorrow, she said, but soon, she promised him; the next fine day.\n","Processing asent: He was very good.\n","Processing asent: He lay down.\n","Processing asent: She covered him up.\n","Processing asent: But he would never forget, she knew, and she felt angry with Charles Tansley, with her husband, and with herself, for she had raised his hopes.\n","Processing asent: Then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar's skull, she got up, and pulled the window down another inch or two, and heard the wind, and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to Mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out.\n","Processing asent: She hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads, she thought, still thinking how annoying Charles Tansley was.\n","Processing asent: For neither of them slept well; they were excitable children, and since he said things like that about the Lighthouse, it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over, just as they were going to sleep, clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow.\n","Processing asent: For she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work.\n","Processing asent: Yet he looked so desolate; yet she would feel relieved when he went; yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow; yet he was admirable with her husband; yet his manners certainly wanted improving; yet she liked his laughthinking this, as she came downstairs, she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase windowthe yellow harvest moon and turned, and they saw her, standing above them on the stairs.\n","Processing asent: \"That's my mother,\" thought Prue.\n","Processing asent: Yes; Minta should look at her; Paul Rayley should look at her.\n","Processing asent: That is the thing itself, she felt, as if there were only one person like that in the world; her mother.\n","Processing asent: And, from having been quite grown up, a moment before, talking with the others, she became a child again, and what they had been doing was a game, and would her mother sanction their game, or condemn it, she wondered.\n","Processing asent: And thinking what a chance it was for Minta and Paul and Lily to see her, and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her, to have her, and how she would never grow up and never leave home, she said, like a child, \"We thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves.\"\n","Processing asent: Instantly, for no reason at all, Mrs. Ramsay became like a girl of twenty, full of gaiety.\n","Processing asent: A mood of revelry suddenly took possession of her.\n","Processing asent: Of course they must go; of course they must go, she cried, laughing; and running down the last three or four steps quickly, she began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing Minta's wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too, and would they be very late, and had any of them got a watch?\n","Processing asent: \"Yes, Paul has,\" said Minta.\n","Processing asent: Paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out of a little wash-leather case to show her.\n","Processing asent: And as he held it in the palm of his hand before her, he felt, \"She knows all about it. I need not say anything.\"\n","Processing asent: He was saying to her as he showed her the watch, \"I've done it, Mrs. Ramsay. I owe it all to you.\"\n","Processing asent: And seeing the gold watch lying in his hand, Mrs. Ramsay felt, How extraordinarily lucky Minta is!\n","Processing asent: She is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash- leather bag!\n","Processing asent: \"How I wish I could come with you!\" she cried.\n","Processing asent: But she was withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was.\n","Processing asent: Of course it was impossible for her to go with them.\n","Processing asent: But she would have liked to go, had it not been for the other thing, and tickled by the absurdity of her thought (how lucky to marry a man with a wash-leather bag for his watch) she went with a smile on her lips into the other room, where her husband sat reading.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 19\n","Processing asent: Of course, she said to herself, coming into the room, she had to come here to get something she wanted.\n","Processing asent: First she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp.\n","Processing asent: But she wanted something more, though she did not know, could not think what it was that she wanted.\n","Processing asent: She looked at her husband (taking up her stocking and beginning to knit), and saw that he did not want to be interrupted that was clear.\n","Processing asent: He was reading something that moved him very much.\n","Processing asent: He was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion.\n","Processing asent: He was tossing the pages over.\n","Processing asent: He was acting itperhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book.\n","Processing asent: She wondered what book it was.\n","Processing asent: Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting.\n","Processing asent: For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above), had been saying that people don't read Scott any more.\n","Processing asent: Then her husband thought, \"That's what they'll say of me;\" so he went and got one of those books.\n","Processing asent: And if he came to the conclusion \"That's true\" what Charles Tansley said, he would accept it about Scott.\n","Processing asent: (She could see that he was weighing, considering, putting this with that as he read.)\n","Processing asent: But not about himself.\n","Processing asent: He was always uneasy about himself.\n","Processing asent: That troubled her.\n","Processing asent: He would always be worrying about his own bookswill they be read, are they good, why aren't they better, what do people think of me?\n","Processing asent: Not liking to think of him so, and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting, wondering if the children were laughing at that, she twitched the stockings out, and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead, and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now, when the breeze falls, settles, leaf by leaf, into quiet.\n","Processing asent: It didn't matter, any of it, she thought.\n","Processing asent: A great man, a great book, famewho could tell?\n","Processing asent: She knew nothing about it.\n","Processing asent: But it was his way with him, his truthfulnessfor instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively, If only he would speak!\n","Processing asent: She had complete trust in him.\n","Processing asent: And dismissing all this, as one passes in diving now a weed, now a straw, now a bubble, she felt again, sinking deeper, as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking, There is something I wantsomething I have come to get, and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was, with her eyes closed.\n","Processing asent: And she waited a little, knitting, wondering, and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner, \"the China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee,\" began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed, words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow, lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across, or to cry out and to be echoed; so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.\n","Processing asent: And all the lives we ever lived And all the lives to be, Are full of trees and changing leaves,\n","Processing asent: she murmured, sticking her needles into the stocking.\n","Processing asent: And she opened the book and began reading here and there at random, and as she did so, she felt that she was climbing backwards, upwards, shoving her way up under petals that curved over her, so that she only knew this is white, or this is red.\n","Processing asent: She did not know at first what the words meant at all.\n","Processing asent: Steer, hither steer your winged pines, all beaten Mariners\n","Processing asent: she read and turned the page, swinging herself, zigzagging this way and that, from one line to another as from one branch to another, from one red and white flower to another, until a little sound roused herher husband slapping his thighs.\n","Processing asent: Their eyes met for a second; but they did not want to speak to each other.\n","Processing asent: They had nothing to say, but something seemed, nevertheless, to go from him to her.\n","Processing asent: It was the life, it was the power of it, it was the tremendous humour, she knew, that made him slap his thighs.\n","Processing asent: Don't interrupt me, he seemed to be saying, don't say anything; just sit there.\n","Processing asent: And he went on reading.\n","Processing asent: His lips twitched.\n","Processing asent: It filled him.\n","Processing asent: It fortified him.\n","Processing asent: He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening, and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably, and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn't exist at all.\n","Processing asent: But now, he felt, it didn't matter a damn who reached Z (if thought ran like an alphabet from A to Z).\n","Processing asent: Somebody would reach itif not he, then another.\n","Processing asent: This man's strength and sanity, his feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in Mucklebackit's cottage made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears.\n","Processing asent: Raising the book a little to hide his face, he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him.\n","Processing asent: Well, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the chapter.\n","Processing asent: He felt that he had been arguing with somebody, and had got the better of him.\n","Processing asent: They could not improve upon that, whatever they might say; and his own position became more secure.\n","Processing asent: The lovers were fiddlesticks, he thought, collecting it all in his mind again.\n","Processing asent: That's fiddlesticks, that's first-rate, he thought, putting one thing beside another.\n","Processing asent: But he must read it again.\n","Processing asent: He could not remember the whole shape of the thing.\n","Processing asent: He had to keep his judgement in suspense.\n","Processing asent: So he returned to the other thoughtif young men did not care for this, naturally they did not care for him either.\n","Processing asent: One ought not to complain, thought Mr. Ramsay, trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him.\n","Processing asent: But he was determined; he would not bother her again.\n","Processing asent: Here he looked at her reading.\n","Processing asent: She looked very peaceful, reading.\n","Processing asent: He liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone.\n","Processing asent: The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would, she really would, but otherwise, might she go on sleeping, just a little longer, just a little longer?\n","Processing asent: She was climbing up those branches, this way and that, laying hands on one flower and then another.\n","Processing asent: Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,\n","Processing asent: she read, and so reading she was ascending, she felt, on to the top, on to the summit.\n","Processing asent: How satisfying!\n","Processing asent: How restful!\n","Processing asent: All the odds and ends of the day stuck to this magnet; her mind felt swept, felt clean.\n","Processing asent: And then there it was, suddenly entire; she held it in her hands, beautiful and reasonable, clear and complete, herethe sonnet.\n","Processing asent: But she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her.\n","Processing asent: He was smiling at her, quizzically, as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight, but at the same time he was thinking, Go on reading.\n","Processing asent: You don't look sad now, he thought.\n","Processing asent: And he wondered what she was reading, and exaggerated her ignorance, her simplicity, for he liked to think that she was not clever, not book-learned at all.\n","Processing asent: He wondered if she understood what she was reading.\n","Processing asent: Probably not, he thought.\n","Processing asent: She was astonishingly beautiful.\n","Processing asent: Her beauty seemed to him, if that were possible, to increase\n","Processing asent: Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,\n","Processing asent: As with your shadow I with these did play, she finished.\n","Processing asent: \"Well?\" she said, echoing his smile dreamily, looking up from her book.\n","Processing asent: As with your shadow I with these did play,\n","Processing asent: she murmured, putting the book on the table.\n","Processing asent: What had happened, she wondered, as she took up her knitting, since she had seen him alone?\n","Processing asent: She remembered dressing, and seeing the moon; Andrew holding his plate too high at dinner; being depressed by something William had said; the birds in the trees; the sofa on the landing; the children being awake; Charles Tansley waking them with his books fallingoh, no, that she had invented; and Paul having a wash- leather case for his watch.\n","Processing asent: Which should she tell him about?\n","Processing asent: \"They're engaged,\" she said, beginning to knit, \"Paul and Minta.\"\n","Processing asent: \"So I guessed,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing very much to be said about it.\n","Processing asent: Her mind was still going up and down, up and down with the poetry; he was still feeling very vigorous, very forthright, after reading about Steenie's funeral.\n","Processing asent: So they sat silent.\n","Processing asent: Then she became aware that she wanted him to say something.\n","Processing asent: Anything, anything, she thought, going on with her knitting.\n","Processing asent: Anything will do.\n","Processing asent: \"How nice it would be to marry a man with a wash-leather bag for his watch,\" she said, for that was the sort of joke they had together.\n","Processing asent: He snorted.\n","Processing asent: He felt about this engagement as he always felt about any engagement; the girl is much too good for that young man.\n","Processing asent: Slowly it came into her head, why is it then that one wants people to marry?\n","Processing asent: What was the value, the meaning of things?\n","Processing asent: (Every word they said now would be true.)\n","Processing asent: Do say something, she thought, wishing only to hear his voice.\n","Processing asent: For the shadow, the thing folding them in was beginning, she felt, to close round her again.\n","Processing asent: Say anything, she begged, looking at him, as if for help.\n","Processing asent: He was silent, swinging the compass on his watch-chain to and fro, and thinking of Scott's novels and Balzac's novels.\n","Processing asent: But through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy, for they were drawing together, involuntarily, coming side by side, quite close, she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind; and he was beginning, now that her thoughts took a turn he dislikedtowards this \"pessimism\" as he called itto fidget, though he said nothing, raising his hand to his forehead, twisting a lock of hair, letting it fall again.\n","Processing asent: \"You won't finish that stocking tonight,\" he said, pointing to her stocking.\n","Processing asent: That was what she wantedthe asperity in his voice reproving her.\n","Processing asent: If he says it's wrong to be pessimistic probably it is wrong, she thought; the marriage will turn out all right.\n","Processing asent: \"No,\" she said, flattening the stocking out upon her knee, \"I shan't finish it.\"\n","Processing asent: And what then?\n","Processing asent: For she felt that he was still looking at her, but that his look had changed.\n","Processing asent: He wanted somethingwanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him; wanted her to tell him that she loved him.\n","Processing asent: And that, no, she could not do.\n","Processing asent: He found talking so much easier than she did.\n","Processing asent: He could say thingsshe never could.\n","Processing asent: So naturally it was always he that said the things, and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly, and would reproach her.\n","Processing asent: A heartless woman he called her; she never told him that she loved him.\n","Processing asent: But it was not soit was not so.\n","Processing asent: It was only that she never could say what she felt.\n","Processing asent: Was there no crumb on his coat?\n","Processing asent: Nothing she could do for him?\n","Processing asent: Getting up, she stood at the window with the reddish-brown stocking in her hands, partly to turn away from him, partly because she remembered how beautiful it often isthe sea at night.\n","Processing asent: But she knew that he had turned his head as she turned; he was watching her.\n","Processing asent: She knew that he was thinking, You are more beautiful than ever.\n","Processing asent: And she felt herself very beautiful.\n","Processing asent: Will you not tell me just for once that you love me?\n","Processing asent: He was thinking that, for he was roused, what with Minta and his book, and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: But she could not do it; she could not say it.\n","Processing asent: Then, knowing that he was watching her, instead of saying anything she turned, holding her stocking, and looked at him.\n","Processing asent: And as she looked at him she began to smile, for though she had not said a word, he knew, of course he knew, that she loved him.\n","Processing asent: He could not deny it.\n","Processing asent: And smiling she looked out of the window and said (thinking to herself, Nothing on earth can equal this happiness)\n","Processing asent: \"Yes, you were right. It's going to be wet tomorrow. You won't be able to go.\"\n","Processing asent: And she looked at him smiling.\n","Processing asent: For she had triumphed again.\n","Processing asent: She had not said it: yet he knew.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER 2 TIME PASSES\n","Processing asent: \"Well, we must wait for the future to show,\" said Mr. Bankes, coming in from the terrace.\n","Processing asent: \"It's almost too dark to see,\" said Andrew, coming up from the beach.\n","Processing asent: \"One can hardly tell which is the sea and which is the land,\" said Prue.\n","Processing asent: \"Do we leave that light burning?\" said Lily as they took their coats off indoors.\n","Processing asent: \"No,\" said Prue, \"not if every one's in.\"\n","Processing asent: \"Andrew,\" she called back, \"just put out the light in the hall.\"\n","Processing asent: One by one the lamps were all extinguished, except that Mr. Carmichael, who liked to lie awake a little reading Virgil, kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 2\n","Processing asent: So with the lamps all put out, the moon sunk, and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began.\n","Processing asent: Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers.\n","Processing asent: Not only was furniture confounded; there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by which one could say, \"This is he\" or \"This is she.\"\n","Processing asent: Sometimes a hand was raised as if to clutch something or ward off something, or somebody groaned, or somebody laughed aloud as if sharing a joke with nothingness.\n","Processing asent: Nothing stirred in the drawing-room or in the dining-room or on the staircase.\n","Processing asent: Only through the rusty hinges and swollen sea-moistened woodwork certain airs, detached from the body of the wind (the house was ramshackle after all) crept round corners and ventured indoors.\n","Processing asent: Almost one might imagine them, as they entered the drawing-room questioning and wondering, toying with the flap of hanging wall-paper, asking, would it hang much longer, when would it fall?\n","Processing asent: Then smoothly brushing the walls, they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall-paper whether they would fade, and questioning (gently, for there was time at their disposal) the torn letters in the wastepaper basket, the flowers, the books, all of which were now open to them and asking, Were they allies?\n","Processing asent: Were they enemies?\n","Processing asent: How long would they endure?\n","Processing asent: So some random light directing them with its pale footfall upon stair and mat, from some uncovered star, or wandering ship, or the Lighthouse even, with its pale footfall upon stair and mat, the little airs mounted the staircase and nosed round bedroom doors.\n","Processing asent: But here surely, they must cease.\n","Processing asent: Whatever else may perish and disappear, what lies here is steadfast.\n","Processing asent: Here one might say to those sliding lights, those fumbling airs that breathe and bend over the bed itself, here you can neither touch nor destroy.\n","Processing asent: Upon which, wearily, ghostlily, as if they had feather-light fingers and the light persistency of feathers, they would look, once, on the shut eyes, and the loosely clasping fingers, and fold their garments wearily and disappear.\n","Processing asent: And so, nosing, rubbing, they went to the window on the staircase, to the servants' bedrooms, to the boxes in the attics; descending, blanched the apples on the dining-room table, fumbled the petals of roses, tried the picture on the easel, brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor.\n","Processing asent: At length, desisting, all ceased together, gathered together, all sighed together; all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to which some door in the kitchen replied; swung wide; admitted nothing; and slammed to.\n","Processing asent: [Here Mr. Carmichael, who was reading Virgil, blew out his candle. It was past midnight.]\n","Processing asent: But what after all is one night?\n","Processing asent: A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of the wave.\n","Processing asent: Night, however, succeeds to night.\n","Processing asent: The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers.\n","Processing asent: They lengthen; they darken.\n","Processing asent: Some of them hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness.\n","Processing asent: The autumn trees, ravaged as they are, take on the flash of tattered flags kindling in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in Indian sands.\n","Processing asent: The autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight, in the light of harvest moons, the light which mellows the energy of labour, and smooths the stubble, and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore.\n","Processing asent: It seemed now as if, touched by human penitence and all its toil, divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it, single, distinct, the hare erect; the wave falling; the boat rocking; which, did we deserve them, should be ours always.\n","Processing asent: But alas, divine goodness, twitching the cord, draws the curtain; it does not please him; he covers his treasures in a drench of hail, and so breaks them, so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth.\n","Processing asent: For our penitence deserves a glimpse only; our toil respite only.\n","Processing asent: The nights now are full of wind and destruction; the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths.\n","Processing asent: Also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts, a sharer of his solitude, throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand, no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul.\n","Processing asent: The hand dwindles in his hand; the voice bellows in his ear.\n","Processing asent: Almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what, and why, and wherefore, which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer.\n","Processing asent: [Mr. Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning, stretched his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before, his arms, though stretched out, remained empty.]]\n","Processing asent: So with the house empty and the doors locked and the mattresses rolled round, those stray airs, advance guards of great armies, blustered in, brushed bare boards, nibbled and fanned, met nothing in bedroom or drawing-room that wholly resisted them but only hangings that flapped, wood that creaked, the bare legs of tables, saucepans and china already furred, tarnished, cracked.\n","Processing asent: What people had shed and lefta pair of shoes, a shooting cap, some faded skirts and coats in wardrobesthose alone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated; how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons; how once the looking-glass had held a face; had held a world hollowed out in which a figure turned, a hand flashed, the door opened, in came children rushing and tumbling; and went out again.\n","Processing asent: Now, day after day, light turned, like a flower reflected in water, its sharp image on the wall opposite.\n","Processing asent: Only the shadows of the trees, flourishing in the wind, made obeisance on the wall, and for a moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself; or birds, flying, made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor.\n","Processing asent: So loveliness reigned and stillness, and together made the shape of loveliness itself, a form from which life had parted; solitary like a pool at evening, far distant, seen from a train window, vanishing so quickly that the pool, pale in the evening, is scarcely robbed of its solitude, though once seen.\n","Processing asent: Loveliness and stillness clasped hands in the bedroom, and among the shrouded jugs and sheeted chairs even the prying of the wind, and the soft nose of the clammy sea airs, rubbing, snuffling, iterating, and reiterating their questions\"Will you fade? Will you perish?\"scarcely disturbed the peace, the indifference, the air of pure integrity, as if the question they asked scarcely needed that they should answer: we remain.\n","Processing asent: Nothing it seemed could break that image, corrupt that innocence, or disturb the swaying mantle of silence which, week after week, in the empty room, wove into itself the falling cries of birds, ships hooting, the drone and hum of the fields, a dog's bark, a man's shout, and folded them round the house in silence.\n","Processing asent: Once only a board sprang on the landing; once in the middle of the night with a roar, with a rupture, as after centuries of quiescence, a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley, one fold of the shawl loosened and swung to and fro.\n","Processing asent: Then again peace descended; and the shadow wavered; light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall; and Mrs. McNab, tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood in the wash-tub, grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle, came as directed to open all windows, and dust the bedrooms.\n","Processing asent: As she lurched (for she rolled like a ship at sea) and leered (for her eyes fell on nothing directly, but with a sidelong glance that deprecated the scorn and anger of the worldshe was witless, she knew it), as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself upstairs and rolled from room to room, she sang.\n","Processing asent: Rubbing the glass of the long looking-glass and leering sideways at her swinging figure a sound issued from her lipssomething that had been gay twenty years before on the stage perhaps, had been hummed and danced to, but now, coming from the toothless, bonneted, care-taking woman, was robbed of meaning, was like the voice of witlessness, humour, persistency itself, trodden down but springing up again, so that as she lurched, dusting, wiping, she seemed to say how it was one long sorrow and trouble, how it was getting up and going to bed again, and bringing things out and putting them away again.\n","Processing asent: It was not easy or snug this world she had known for close on seventy years.\n","Processing asent: Bowed down she was with weariness.\n","Processing asent: How long, she asked, creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed, dusting the boards, how long shall it endure?\n","Processing asent: but hobbled to her feet again, pulled herself up, and again with her sidelong leer which slipped and turned aside even from her own face, and her own sorrows, stood and gaped in the glass, aimlessly smiling, and began again the old amble and hobble, taking up mats, putting down china, looking sideways in the glass, as if, after all, she had her consolations, as if indeed there twined about her dirge some incorrigible hope.\n","Processing asent: Visions of joy there must have been at the wash- tub, say with her children (yet two had been base-born and one had deserted her), at the public-house, drinking; turning over scraps in her drawers.\n","Processing asent: Some cleavage of the dark there must have been, some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her, turning to her job again, mumble out the old music hall song.\n","Processing asent: The mystic, the visionary, walking the beach on a fine night, stirring a puddle, looking at a stone, asking themselves \"What am I,\" \"What is this?\" had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them: (they could not say what it was) so that they were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert.\n","Processing asent: But Mrs. McNab continued to drink and gossip as before.\n","Processing asent: The Spring without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields wide- eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by the beholders.\n","Processing asent: [Prue Ramsay, leaning on her father's arm, was given in marriage. What, people said, could have been more fitting? And, they added, how beautiful she looked!]\n","Processing asent: As summer neared, as the evenings lengthened, there came to the wakeful, the hopeful, walking the beach, stirring the pool, imaginations of the strangest kindof flesh turned to atoms which drove before the wind, of stars flashing in their hearts, of cliff, sea, cloud, and sky brought purposely together to assemble outwardly the scattered parts of the vision within.\n","Processing asent: In those mirrors, the minds of men, in those pools of uneasy water, in which clouds for ever turn and shadows form, dreams persisted, and it was impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull, flower, tree, man and woman, and the white earth itself seemed to declare (but if questioned at once to withdraw) that good triumphs, happiness prevails, order rules; or to resist the extraordinary stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute good, some crystal of intensity, remote from the known pleasures and familiar virtues, something alien to the processes of domestic life, single, hard, bright, like a diamond in the sand, which would render the possessor secure.\n","Processing asent: Moreover, softened and acquiescent, the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak about her, veiled her eyes, averted her head, and among passing shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of the sorrows of mankind.\n","Processing asent: [Prue Ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy, people said, everything, they said, had promised so well.]\n","Processing asent: And now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house again.\n","Processing asent: Flies wove a web in the sunny rooms; weeds that had grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane.\n","Processing asent: When darkness fell, the stroke of the Lighthouse, which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness, tracing its pattern, came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again.\n","Processing asent: But in the very lull of this loving caress, as the long stroke leant upon the bed, the rock was rent asunder; another fold of the shawl loosened; there it hung, and swayed.\n","Processing asent: Through the short summer nights and the long summer days, when the empty rooms seemed to murmur with the echoes of the fields and the hum of flies, the long streamer waved gently, swayed aimlessly; while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that Mrs. McNab, when she broke in and lurched about, dusting, sweeping, looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun-lanced waters.\n","Processing asent: But slumber and sleep though it might there came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of hammers dulled on felt, which, with their repeated shocks still further loosened the shawl and cracked the tea-cups.\n","Processing asent: Now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too.\n","Processing asent: Then again silence fell; and then, night after night, and sometimes in plain mid-day when the roses were bright and light turned on the wall its shape clearly there seemed to drop into this silence, this indifference, this integrity, the thud of something falling.\n","Processing asent: [A shell exploded. Twenty or thirty young men were blown up in France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was instantaneous.]\n","Processing asent: At that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask of the sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they affirmed had to consider among the usual tokens of divine bountythe sunset on the sea, the pallor of dawn, the moon rising, fishing-boats against the moon, and children making mud pies or pelting each other with handfuls of grass, something out of harmony with this jocundity and this serenity.\n","Processing asent: There was the silent apparition of an ashen-coloured ship for instance, come, gone; there was a purplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if something had boiled and bled, invisibly, beneath.\n","Processing asent: This intrusion into a scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the most comfortable conclusions stayed their pacing.\n","Processing asent: It was difficult blandly to overlook them; to abolish their significance in the landscape; to continue, as one walked by the sea, to marvel how beauty outside mirrored beauty within.\n","Processing asent: Did Nature supplement what man advanced?\n","Processing asent: Did she complete what he began?\n","Processing asent: With equal complacence she saw his misery, his meanness, and his torture.\n","Processing asent: That dream, of sharing, completing, of finding in solitude on the beach an answer, was then but a reflection in a mirror, and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath?\n","Processing asent: Impatient, despairing yet loth to go (for beauty offers her lures, has her consolations), to pace the beach was impossible; contemplation was unendurable; the mirror was broken.\n","Processing asent: [Mr. Carmichael brought out a volume of poems that spring, which had an unexpected success. The war, people said, had revived their interest in poetry.]\n","Processing asent: Night after night, summer and winter, the torment of storms, the arrow- like stillness of fine (had there been any one to listen) from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing, as the winds and waves disported themselves like the amorphous bulks of leviathans whose brows are pierced by no light of reason, and mounted one on top of another, and lunged and plunged in the darkness or the daylight (for night and day, month and year ran shapelessly together) in idiot games, until it seemed as if the universe were battling and tumbling, in brute confusion and wanton lust aimlessly by itself.\n","Processing asent: In spring the garden urns, casually filled with wind-blown plants, were gay as ever.\n","Processing asent: Violets came and daffodils.\n","Processing asent: But the stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night, with the trees standing there, and the flowers standing there, looking before them, looking up, yet beholding nothing, eyeless, and so terrible.\n","Processing asent: Thinking no harm, for the family would not come, never again, some said, and the house would be sold at Michaelmas perhaps, Mrs. McNab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her.\n","Processing asent: She laid them on the table while she dusted.\n","Processing asent: She was fond of flowers.\n","Processing asent: It was a pity to let them waste.\n","Processing asent: Suppose the house were sold (she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking-glass) it would want seeing toit would.\n","Processing asent: There it had stood all these years without a soul in it.\n","Processing asent: The books and things were mouldy, for, what with the war and help being hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished.\n","Processing asent: It was beyond one person's strength to get it straight now.\n","Processing asent: She was too old.\n","Processing asent: Her legs pained her.\n","Processing asent: All those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun; there was plaster fallen in the hall; the rain-pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in; the carpet was ruined quite.\n","Processing asent: But people should come themselves; they should have sent somebody down to see.\n","Processing asent: For there were clothes in the cupboards; they had left clothes in all the bedrooms.\n","Processing asent: What was she to do with them?\n","Processing asent: They had the moth in themMrs.\n","Processing asent: Ramsay's things.\n","Processing asent: Poor lady!\n","Processing asent: She would never want THEM again.\n","Processing asent: She was dead, they said; years ago, in London.\n","Processing asent: There was the old grey cloak she wore gardening (Mrs. McNab fingered it).\n","Processing asent: She could see her, as she came up the drive with the washing, stooping over her flowers (the garden was a pitiful sight now, all run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds)she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak.\n","Processing asent: There were boots and shoes; and a brush and comb left on the dressing-table, for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: (She had died very sudden at the end, they said.)\n","Processing asent: And once they had been coming, but had put off coming, what with the war, and travel being so difficult these days; they had never come all these years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came, and expected to find things as they had left them, ah, dear!\n","Processing asent: Why the dressing-table drawers were full of things (she pulled them open), handkerchiefs, bits of ribbon.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she could see Mrs. Ramsay as she came up the drive with the washing.\n","Processing asent: \"Good-evening, Mrs. McNab,\" she would say.\n","Processing asent: She had a pleasant way with her.\n","Processing asent: The girls all liked her.\n","Processing asent: But, dear, many things had changed since then (she shut the drawer); many families had lost their dearest.\n","Processing asent: So she was dead; and Mr. Andrew killed; and Miss Prue dead too, they said, with her first baby; but everyone had lost some one these years.\n","Processing asent: Prices had gone up shamefully, and didn't come down again neither.\n","Processing asent: She could well remember her in her grey cloak.\n","Processing asent: \"Good-evening, Mrs. McNab,\" she said, and told cook to keep a plate of milk soup for herquite thought she wanted it, carrying that heavy basket all the way up from town.\n","Processing asent: She could see her now, stooping over her flowers; and faint and flickering, like a yellow beam or the circle at the end of a telescope, a lady in a grey cloak, stooping over her flowers, went wandering over the bedroom wall, up the dressing-table, across the wash-stand, as Mrs. McNab hobbled and ambled, dusting, straightening.\n","Processing asent: And cook's name now?\n","Processing asent: Mildred?\n","Processing asent: Marian?some name like that.\n","Processing asent: Ah, she had forgottenshe did forget things.\n","Processing asent: Fiery, like all red-haired women.\n","Processing asent: Many a laugh they had had.\n","Processing asent: She was always welcome in the kitchen.\n","Processing asent: She made them laugh, she did.\n","Processing asent: Things were better then than now.\n","Processing asent: She sighed; there was too much work for one woman.\n","Processing asent: She wagged her head this side and that.\n","Processing asent: This had been the nursery.\n","Processing asent: Why, it was all damp in here; the plaster was falling.\n","Processing asent: Whatever did they want to hang a beast's skull there?\n","Processing asent: gone mouldy too.\n","Processing asent: And rats in all the attics.\n","Processing asent: The rain came in.\n","Processing asent: But they never sent; never came.\n","Processing asent: Some of the locks had gone, so the doors banged.\n","Processing asent: She didn't like to be up here at dusk alone neither.\n","Processing asent: It was too much for one woman, too much, too much.\n","Processing asent: She creaked, she moaned.\n","Processing asent: She banged the door.\n","Processing asent: She turned the key in the lock, and left the house alone, shut up, locked.\n","Processing asent: The house was left; the house was deserted.\n","Processing asent: It was left like a shell on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it.\n","Processing asent: The long night seemed to have set in; the trifling airs, nibbling, the clammy breaths, fumbling, seemed to have triumphed.\n","Processing asent: The saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed.\n","Processing asent: Toads had nosed their way in.\n","Processing asent: Idly, aimlessly, the swaying shawl swung to and fro.\n","Processing asent: A thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder.\n","Processing asent: The swallows nested in the drawing- roon; the floor was strewn with straw; the plaster fell in shovelfuls; rafters were laid bare; rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots.\n","Processing asent: Tortoise-shell butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window-pane.\n","Processing asent: Poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias; the lawn waved with long grass; giant artichokes towered among roses; a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages; while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become, on winters' nights, a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole room green in summer.\n","Processing asent: What power could now prevent the fertility, the insensibility of nature?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. McNab's dream of a lady, of a child, of a plate of milk soup?\n","Processing asent: It had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished.\n","Processing asent: She had locked the door; she had gone.\n","Processing asent: It was beyond the strength of one woman, she said.\n","Processing asent: They never sent.\n","Processing asent: They never wrote.\n","Processing asent: There were things up there rotting in the drawersit was a shame to leave them so, she said.\n","Processing asent: The place was gone to rack and ruin.\n","Processing asent: Only the Lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw.\n","Processing asent: Nothing now withstood them; nothing said no to them.\n","Processing asent: Let the wind blow; let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage.\n","Processing asent: Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the arm-chairs.\n","Processing asent: Let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries.\n","Processing asent: For now had come that moment, that hesitation when dawn trembles and night pauses, when if a feather alight in the scale it will be weighed down.\n","Processing asent: One feather, and the house, sinking, falling, would have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness.\n","Processing asent: In the ruined room, picnickers would have lit their kettles; lovers sought shelter there, lying on the bare boards; and the shepherd stored his dinner on the bricks, and the tramp slept with his coat round him to ward off the cold.\n","Processing asent: Then the roof would have fallen; briars and hemlocks would have blotted out path, step and window; would have grown, unequally but lustily over the mound, until some trespasser, losing his way, could have told only by a red-hot poker among the nettles, or a scrap of china in the hemlock, that here once some one had lived; there had been a house.\n","Processing asent: If the feather had fallen, if it had tipped the scale downwards, the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of oblivion.\n","Processing asent: But there was a force working; something not highly conscious; something that leered, something that lurched; something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. McNab groaned; Mrs. Bast creaked.\n","Processing asent: They were old; they were stiff; their legs ached.\n","Processing asent: They came with their brooms and pails at last; they got to work.\n","Processing asent: All of a sudden, would Mrs. McNab see that the house was ready, one of the young ladies wrote: would she get this done; would she get that done; all in a hurry.\n","Processing asent: They might be coming for the summer; had left everything to the last; expected to find things as they had left them.\n","Processing asent: Slowly and painfully, with broom and pail, mopping, scouring, Mrs. McNab, Mrs. Bast, stayed the corruption and the rot; rescued from the pool of Time that was fast closing over them now a basin, now a cupboard; fetched up from oblivion all the Waverley novels and a tea-set one morning; in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender and a set of steel fire-irons.\n","Processing asent: George, Mrs. Bast's son, caught the rats, and cut the grass.\n","Processing asent: They had the builders.\n","Processing asent: Attended with the creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts, the slamming and banging of damp-swollen woodwork, some rusty laborious birth seemed to be taking place, as the women, stooping, rising, groaning, singing, slapped and slammed, upstairs now, now down in the cellars.\n","Processing asent: Oh, they said, the work!\n","Processing asent: They drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes, or in the study; breaking off work at mid-day with the smudge on their faces, and their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles.\n","Processing asent: Flopped on chairs, they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and bath; now the more arduous, more partial triumph over long rows of books, black as ravens once, now white-stained, breeding pale mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders.\n","Processing asent: Once more, as she felt the tea warm in her, the telescope fitted itself to Mrs. McNab's eyes, and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman, lean as a rake, wagging his head, as she came up with the washing, talking to himself, she supposed, on the lawn.\n","Processing asent: He never noticed her.\n","Processing asent: Some said he was dead; some said she was dead.\n","Processing asent: Which was it?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Bast didn't know for certain either.\n","Processing asent: The young gentleman was dead.\n","Processing asent: That she was sure.\n","Processing asent: She had read his name in the papers.\n","Processing asent: There was the cook now, Mildred, Marian, some such name as thata red- headed woman, quick-tempered like all her sort, but kind, too, if you knew the way with her.\n","Processing asent: Many a laugh they had had together.\n","Processing asent: She saved a plate of soup for Maggie; a bite of ham, sometimes; whatever was over.\n","Processing asent: They lived well in those days.\n","Processing asent: They had everything they wanted (glibly, jovially, with the tea hot in her, she unwound her ball of memories, sitting in the wicker arm-chair by the nursery fender).\n","Processing asent: There was always plenty doing, people in the house, twenty staying sometimes, and washing up till long past midnight.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Bast (she had never known them; had lived in Glasgow at that time) wondered, putting her cup down, whatever they hung that beast's skull there for?\n","Processing asent: Shot in foreign parts no doubt.\n","Processing asent: It might well be, said Mrs. McNab, wantoning on with her memories; they had friends in eastern countries; gentlemen staying there, ladies in evening dress; she had seen them once through the dining-room door all sitting at dinner.\n","Processing asent: Twenty she dared say all in their jewellery, and she asked to stay help wash up, might be till after midnight.\n","Processing asent: Ah, said Mrs. Bast, they'd find it changed.\n","Processing asent: She leant out of the window.\n","Processing asent: She watched her son George scything the grass.\n","Processing asent: They might well ask, what had been done to it?\n","Processing asent: seeing how old Kennedy was supposed to have charge of it, and then his leg got so bad after he fell from the cart; and perhaps then no one for a year, or the better part of one; and then Davie Macdonald, and seeds might be sent, but who should say if they were ever planted?\n","Processing asent: They'd find it changed.\n","Processing asent: She watched her son scything.\n","Processing asent: He was a great one for workone of those quiet ones.\n","Processing asent: Well they must be getting along with the cupboards, she supposed.\n","Processing asent: They hauled themselves up.\n","Processing asent: At last, after days of labour within, of cutting and digging without, dusters were flicked from the windows, the windows were shut to, keys were turned all over the house; the front door was banged; it was finished.\n","Processing asent: And now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half-heard melody, that intermittent music which the ear half catches but lets fall; a bark, a bleat; irregular, intermittent, yet somehow related; the hum of an insect, the tremor of cut grass, disevered yet somehow belonging; the jar of a dorbeetle, the squeak of a wheel, loud, low, but mysteriously related; which the ear strains to bring together and is always on the verge of harmonising, but they are never quite heard, never fully harmonised, and at last, in the evening, one after another the sounds die out, and the harmony falters, and silence falls.\n","Processing asent: With the sunset sharpness was lost, and like mist rising, quiet rose, quiet spread, the wind settled; loosely the world shook itself down to sleep, darkly here without a light to it, save what came green suffused through leaves, or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window.\n","Processing asent: [Lily Briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one evening in September. Mr. Carmichael came by the same train.]\n","Processing asent: SECTION 10\n","Processing asent: Then indeed peace had come.\n","Processing asent: Messages of peace breathed from the sea to the shore.\n","Processing asent: Never to break its sleep any more, to lull it rather more deeply to rest, and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily, dreamt wisely, to confirmwhat else was it murmuringas Lily Briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room and heard the sea.\n","Processing asent: Through the open window the voice of the beauty of the world came murmuring, too softly to hear exactly what it saidbut what mattered if the meaning were plain?\n","Processing asent: entreating the sleepers (the house was full again; Mrs. Beckwith was staying there, also Mr. Carmichael), if they would not actually come down to the beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out.\n","Processing asent: They would see then night flowing down in purple; his head crowned; his sceptre jewelled; and how in his eyes a child might look.\n","Processing asent: And if they still faltered (Lily was tired out with travelling and slept almost at once; but Mr. Carmichael read a book by candlelight), if they still said no, that it was vapour, this splendour of his, and the dew had more power than he, and they preferred sleeping; gently then without complaint, or argument, the voice would sing its song.\n","Processing asent: Gently the waves would break (Lily heard them in her sleep); tenderly the light fell (it seemed to come through her eyelids).\n","Processing asent: And it all looked, Mr. Carmichael thought, shutting his book, falling asleep, much as it used to look.\n","Processing asent: Indeed the voice might resume, as the curtains of dark wrapped themselves over the house, over Mrs. Beckwith, Mr. Carmichael, and Lily Briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on their eyes, why not accept this, be content with this, acquiesce and resign?\n","Processing asent: The sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the isles soothed them; the night wrapped them; nothing broke their sleep, until, the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin voices in to its whiteness, a cart grinding, a dog somewhere barking, the sun lifted the curtains, broke the veil on their eyes, and Lily Briscoe stirring in her sleep.\n","Processing asent: She clutched at her blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes opened wide.\n","Processing asent: Here she was again, she thought, sitting bold upright in bed.\n","Processing asent: Awake.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER 3 THE LIGHTHOUSE\n","Processing asent: What does it mean then, what can it all mean?\n","Processing asent: Lily Briscoe asked herself, wondering whether, since she had been left alone, it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here.\n","Processing asent: What does it mean?a catchword that was, caught up from some book, fitting her thought loosely, for she could not, this first morning with the Ramsays, contract her feelings, could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk.\n","Processing asent: For really, what did she feel, come back after all these years and Mrs. Ramsay dead?\n","Processing asent: Nothing, nothingnothing that she could express at all.\n","Processing asent: She had come late last night when it was all mysterious, dark.\n","Processing asent: Now she was awake, at her old place at the breakfast table, but alone.\n","Processing asent: It was very early too, not yet eight.\n","Processing asent: There was this expeditionthey were going to the Lighthouse, Mr. Ramsay, Cam, and James.\n","Processing asent: They should have gone alreadythey had to catch the tide or something.\n","Processing asent: And Cam was not ready and James was not ready and Nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and Mr. Ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room.\n","Processing asent: \"What's the use of going now?\" he had stormed.\n","Processing asent: Nancy had vanished.\n","Processing asent: There he was, marching up and down the terrace in a rage.\n","Processing asent: One seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house.\n","Processing asent: Now Nancy burst in, and asked, looking round the room, in a queer half dazed, half desperate way, \"What does one send to the Lighthouse?\" as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do.\n","Processing asent: What does one send to the Lighthouse indeed!\n","Processing asent: At any other time Lily could have suggested reasonably tea, tobacco, newspapers.\n","Processing asent: But this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like Nancy'sWhat does one send to the Lighthouse?opened doors in one's mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking, in a stupefied gape, What does one send?\n","Processing asent: What does one do?\n","Processing asent: Why is one sitting here, after all?\n","Processing asent: Sitting alone (for Nancy went out again) among the clean cups at the long table, she felt cut off from other people, and able only to go on watching, asking, wondering.\n","Processing asent: The house, the place, the morning, all seemed strangers to her.\n","Processing asent: She had no attachment here, she felt, no relations with it, anything might happen, and whatever did happen, a step outside, a voice calling (\"It's not in the cupboard; it's on the landing,\" some one cried), was a question, as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut, and they floated up here, down there, off, anyhow.\n","Processing asent: How aimless it was,, how chaotic, how unreal it was, she thought, looking at her empty coffee cup.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay dead; Andrew killed; Prue dead toorepeat it as she might, it roused no feeling in her.\n","Processing asent: And we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this, she said, looking out of the window.\n","Processing asent: It was a beautiful still day.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly Mr. Ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating, as if he saw you, for one second, for the first time, for ever; and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape himto escape his demand on her, to put aside a moment longer that imperious need.\n","Processing asent: And he shook his head at her, and strode on (\"Alone\" she heard him say, \"Perished\" she heard him say) and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols, wrote themselves all over the grey-green walls.\n","Processing asent: If only she could put them together, she felt, write them out in some sentence, then she would have got at the truth of things.\n","Processing asent: Old Mr. Carmichael came padding softly in, fetched his coffee, took his cup and made off to sit in the sun.\n","Processing asent: The extraordinary unreality was frightening; but it was also exciting.\n","Processing asent: Going to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: But what does one send to the Lighthouse?\n","Processing asent: Perished.\n","Processing asent: Alone.\n","Processing asent: The grey-green light on the wall opposite.\n","Processing asent: The empty places.\n","Processing asent: Such were some of the parts, but how bring them together?\n","Processing asent: she asked.\n","Processing asent: As if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest Mr. Ramsay should see her.\n","Processing asent: She must escape somewhere, be alone somewhere.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly she remembered.\n","Processing asent: When she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she had looked at in a moment of revelation.\n","Processing asent: There had been a problem about a foreground of a picture.\n","Processing asent: Move the tree to the middle, she had said.\n","Processing asent: She had never finished that picture.\n","Processing asent: She would paint that picture now.\n","Processing asent: It had been knocking about in her mind all these years.\n","Processing asent: Where were her paints, she wondered?\n","Processing asent: Her paints, yes.\n","Processing asent: She had left them in the hall last night.\n","Processing asent: She would start at once.\n","Processing asent: She got up quickly, before Mr. Ramsay turned.\n","Processing asent: She fetched herself a chair.\n","Processing asent: She pitched her easel with her precise old-maidish movements on the edge of the lawn, not too close to Mr. Carmichael, but close enough for his protection.\n","Processing asent: Yes, it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago.\n","Processing asent: There was the wall; the hedge; the tree.\n","Processing asent: The question was of some relation between those masses.\n","Processing asent: She had borne it in her mind all these years.\n","Processing asent: It seemed as if the solution had come to her: she knew now what she wanted to do.\n","Processing asent: But with Mr. Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing.\n","Processing asent: Every time he approachedhe was walking up and down the terraceruin approached, chaos approached.\n","Processing asent: She could not paint.\n","Processing asent: She stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube.\n","Processing asent: But all she did was to ward him off a moment.\n","Processing asent: He made it impossible for her to do anything.\n","Processing asent: For if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her, saying, as he had said last night, \"You find us much changed.\"\n","Processing asent: Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said that.\n","Processing asent: Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of Englandthe Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthlessshe felt how they raged under it.\n","Processing asent: Kind old Mrs. Beckwith said something sensible.\n","Processing asent: But it was a house full of unrelated passionsshe had felt that all the evening.\n","Processing asent: And on top of this chaos Mr. Ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: \"You will find us much changed\" and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it.\n","Processing asent: Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger.\n","Processing asent: Then he reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: They must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past seven.\n","Processing asent: Then, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them.\n","Processing asent: Did they not want to go?\n","Processing asent: he demanded.\n","Processing asent: Had they dared say No (he had some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair.\n","Processing asent: Such a gift he had for gesture.\n","Processing asent: He looked like a king in exile.\n","Processing asent: Doggedly James said yes.\n","Processing asent: Cam stumbled more wretchedly.\n","Processing asent: Yes, oh, yes, they'd both be ready, they said.\n","Processing asent: And it struck her, this was tragedynot palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued.\n","Processing asent: James was sixteen, Cam, seventeen, perhaps.\n","Processing asent: She had looked round for some one who was not there, for Mrs. Ramsay, presumably.\n","Processing asent: But there was only kind Mrs. Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp.\n","Processing asent: Then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone under.\n","Processing asent: It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed the staircase window.\n","Processing asent: She had slept at once.\n","Processing asent: She set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel, as a barrier, frail, but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off Mr. Ramsay and his exactingness.\n","Processing asent: She did her best to look, when his back was turned, at her picture; that line there, that mass there.\n","Processing asent: But it was out of the question.\n","Processing asent: Let him be fifty feet away, let him not even speak to you, let him not even see you, he permeated, he prevailed, he imposed himself.\n","Processing asent: He changed everything.\n","Processing asent: She could not see the colour; she could not see the lines; even with his back turned to her, she could only think, But he'll be down on me in a moment, demandingsomething she felt she could not give him.\n","Processing asent: She rejected one brush; she chose another.\n","Processing asent: When would those children come?\n","Processing asent: When would they all be off?\n","Processing asent: she fidgeted.\n","Processing asent: That man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never gave; that man took.\n","Processing asent: She, on the other hand, would be forced to give.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay had given.\n","Processing asent: Giving, giving, giving, she had diedand had left all this.\n","Processing asent: Really, she was angry with Mrs. Ramsay.\n","Processing asent: With the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall.\n","Processing asent: It was all Mrs. Ramsay's doing.\n","Processing asent: She was dead.\n","Processing asent: Here was Lily, at forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there, playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and it was all Mrs. Ramsay's fault.\n","Processing asent: She was dead.\n","Processing asent: The step where she used to sit was empty.\n","Processing asent: She was dead.\n","Processing asent: But why repeat this over and over again?\n","Processing asent: Why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got?\n","Processing asent: There was a kind of blasphemy in it.\n","Processing asent: It was all dry: all withered: all spent.\n","Processing asent: They ought not to have asked her; she ought not to have come.\n","Processing asent: One can't waste one's time at forty- four, she thought.\n","Processing asent: She hated playing at painting.\n","Processing asent: A brush, the one dependable thing in a world of strife, ruin, chaosthat one should not play with, knowingly even: she detested it.\n","Processing asent: But he made her.\n","Processing asent: You shan't touch your canvas, he seemed to say, bearing down on her, till you've given me what I want of you.\n","Processing asent: Here he was, close upon her again, greedy, distraught.\n","Processing asent: Well, thought Lily in despair, letting her right hand fall at her side, it would be simpler then to have it over.\n","Processing asent: Surely, she could imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the self-surrender, she had seen on so many women's faces (on Mrs. Ramsay's, for instance) when on some occasion like this they blazed upshe could remember the look on Mrs. Ramsay's faceinto a rapture of sympathy, of delight in the reward they had, which, though the reason of it escaped her, evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable.\n","Processing asent: Here he was, stopped by her side.\n","Processing asent: She would give him what she could.\n","Processing asent: She seemed to have shrivelled slightly, he thought.\n","Processing asent: She looked a little skimpy, wispy; but not unattractive.\n","Processing asent: He liked her.\n","Processing asent: There had been some talk of her marrying William Bankes once, but nothing had come of it.\n","Processing asent: His wife had been fond of her.\n","Processing asent: He had been a little out of temper too at breakfast.\n","Processing asent: And then, and thenthis was one of those moments when an enormous need urged him, without being conscious what it was, to approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.\n","Processing asent: Was anybody looking after her?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: Had she everything she wanted?\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, thanks, everything,\" said Lily Briscoe nervously.\n","Processing asent: No; she could not do it.\n","Processing asent: She ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous.\n","Processing asent: But she remained stuck.\n","Processing asent: There was an awful pause.\n","Processing asent: They both looked at the sea.\n","Processing asent: Why, thought Mr. Ramsay, should she look at the sea when I am here?\n","Processing asent: She hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the Lighthouse, she said.\n","Processing asent: The Lighthouse!\n","Processing asent: The Lighthouse!\n","Processing asent: What's that got to do with it?\n","Processing asent: he thought impatiently.\n","Processing asent: Instantly, with the force of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain himself any longer), there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something, said somethingall except myself, thought Lily, girding at herself bitterly, who am not a woman, but a peevish, ill-tempered, dried-up old maid, presumably.\n","Processing asent: [Mr.\n","Processing asent: Ramsay sighed to the full.\n","Processing asent: He waited.\n","Processing asent: Was she not going to say anything?\n","Processing asent: Did she not see what he wanted from her?\n","Processing asent: Then he said he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: His wife used to send the men things.\n","Processing asent: There was a poor boy with a tuberculous hip, the lightkeeper's son.\n","Processing asent: He sighed profoundly.\n","Processing asent: He sighed significantly.\n","Processing asent: All Lily wished was that this enormous flood of grief, this insatiable hunger for sympathy, this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely, and even so he had sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever, should leave her, should be diverted (she kept looking at the house, hoping for an interruption) before it swept her down in its flow.\n","Processing asent: \"Such expeditions,\" said Mr. Ramsay, scraping the ground with his toe, \"are very painful.\"\n","Processing asent: Still Lily said nothing.\n","Processing asent: (She is a stock, she is a stone, he said to himself.) \"They are very exhausting,\" he said, looking, with a sickly look that nauseated her (he was acting, she felt, this great man was dramatising himself), at his beautiful hands.\n","Processing asent: It was horrible, it was indecent.\n","Processing asent: Would they never come, she asked, for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow, support these heavy draperies of grief (he had assumed a pose of extreme decreptitude; he even tottered a little as he stood there) a moment longer.\n","Processing asent: Still she could say nothing; the whole horizon seemed swept bare of objects to talk about; could only feel, amazedly, as Mr. Ramsay stood there, how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and discolour it, and cast over the rubicund, drowsy, entirely contented figure of Mr. Carmichael, reading a French novel on a deck-chair, a veil of crape, as if such an existence, flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe, were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all.\n","Processing asent: Look at him, he seemed to be saying, look at me; and indeed, all the time he was feeling, Think of me, think of me.\n","Processing asent: Ah, could that bulk only be wafted alongside of them, Lily wished; had she only pitched her easel a yard or two closer to him; a man, any man, would staunch this effusion, would stop these lamentations.\n","Processing asent: A woman, she had provoked this horror; a woman, she should have known how to deal with it.\n","Processing asent: It was immensely to her discredit, sexually, to stand there dumb.\n","Processing asent: One saidwhat did one say?Oh, Mr. Ramsay!\n","Processing asent: Dear Mr. Ramsay!\n","Processing asent: That was what that kind old lady who sketched, Mrs. Beckwith, would have said instantly, and rightly.\n","Processing asent: But, no.\n","Processing asent: They stood there, isolated from the rest of the world.\n","Processing asent: His immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at ther feet, and all she did, miserable sinner that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles, lest she should get wet.\n","Processing asent: In complete silence she stood there, grasping her paint brush.\n","Processing asent: Heaven could never be sufficiently praised!\n","Processing asent: She heard sounds in the house.\n","Processing asent: James and Cam must be coming.\n","Processing asent: But Mr. Ramsay, as if he knew that his time ran short, exerted upon her solitary figure the immense pressure of his concentrated woe; his age; his frailty: his desolation; when suddenly, tossing his head impatiently, in his annoyancefor after all, what woman could resist him?he noticed that his boot-laces were untied.\n","Processing asent: Remarkable boots they were too, Lily thought, looking down at them: sculptured; colossal; like everything that Mr. Ramsay wore, from his frayed tie to his half-buttoned waistcoat, his own indisputably.\n","Processing asent: She could see them walking to his room of their own accord, expressive in his absence of pathos, surliness, ill-temper, charm.\n","Processing asent: \"What beautiful boots!\" she exclaimed.\n","Processing asent: She was ashamed of herself.\n","Processing asent: To praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul; when he had shown her his bleeding hands, his lacerated heart, and asked her to pity them, then to say, cheerfully, \"Ah, but what beautiful boots you wear!\" deserved, she knew, and she looked up expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill-temper complete annihilation.\n","Processing asent: Instead, Mr. Ramsay smiled.\n","Processing asent: His pall, his draperies, his infirmities fell from him.\n","Processing asent: Ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up for her to look at, they were first-rate boots.\n","Processing asent: There was only one man in England who could make boots like that.\n","Processing asent: Boots are among the chief curses of mankind, he said.\n","Processing asent: \"Bootmakers make it their business,\" he exclaimed, \"to cripple and torture the human foot.\"\n","Processing asent: They are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind.\n","Processing asent: It had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made.\n","Processing asent: He would have her observe (he lifted his right foot and then his left) that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before.\n","Processing asent: They were made of the finest leather in the world, also.\n","Processing asent: Most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard.\n","Processing asent: He looked complacently at his foot, still held in the air.\n","Processing asent: They had reached, she felt, a sunny island where peace dwelt, sanity reigned and the sun for ever shone, the blessed island of good boots.\n","Processing asent: Her heart warmed to him.\n","Processing asent: \"Now let me see if you can tie a knot,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: He poohpoohed her feeble system.\n","Processing asent: He showed her his own invention.\n","Processing asent: Once you tied it, it never came undone.\n","Processing asent: Three times he knotted her shoe; three times he unknotted it.\n","Processing asent: Why, at this completely inappropriate moment, when he was stooping over her shoe, should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that, as she stooped too, the blood rushed to her face, and, thinking of her callousness (she had called him a play-actor) she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears?\n","Processing asent: Thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos.\n","Processing asent: He tied knots.\n","Processing asent: He bought boots.\n","Processing asent: There was no helping Mr. Ramsay on the journey he was going.\n","Processing asent: But now just as she wished to say something, could have said something, perhaps, here they wereCam and James.\n","Processing asent: They appeared on the terrace.\n","Processing asent: They came, lagging, side by side, a serious, melancholy couple.\n","Processing asent: But why was it like THAT that they came?\n","Processing asent: She could not help feeling annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully; they might have given him what, now that they were off, she would not have the chance of giving him.\n","Processing asent: For she felt a sudden emptiness; a frustration.\n","Processing asent: Her feeling had come too late; there it was ready; but he no longer needed it.\n","Processing asent: He had become a very distinguished, elderly man, who had no need of her whatsoever.\n","Processing asent: She felt snubbed.\n","Processing asent: He slung a knapsack round his shoulders.\n","Processing asent: He shared out the parcelsthere were a number of them, ill tied in brown paper.\n","Processing asent: He sent Cam for a cloak.\n","Processing asent: He had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition.\n","Processing asent: Then, wheeling about, he led the way with his firm military tread, in those wonderful boots, carrying brown paper parcels, down the path, his children following him.\n","Processing asent: They looked, she thought, as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise, and they went to it, still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence.\n","Processing asent: So they passed the edge of the lawn, and it seemed to Lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging as it was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her.\n","Processing asent: Politely, but very distantly, Mr. Ramsay raised his hand and saluted her as they passed.\n","Processing asent: But what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression.\n","Processing asent: What had made it like that?\n","Processing asent: Thinking, night after night, she supposedabout the reality of kitchen tables, she added, remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what Mr. Ramsay did think about Andrew had given her.\n","Processing asent: (He had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly, she bethought her.)\n","Processing asent: The kitchen table was something visionary, austere; something bare, hard, not ornamental.\n","Processing asent: There was no colour to it; it was all edges and angles; it was uncompromisingly plain.\n","Processing asent: But Mr. Ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded, until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her.\n","Processing asent: Then, she recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush), worries had fretted itnot so nobly.\n","Processing asent: He must have had his doubts about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table; whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able after all to find it.\n","Processing asent: He had had doubts, she felt, or he would have asked less of people.\n","Processing asent: That was what they talked about late at night sometimes, she suspected; and then next day Mrs. Ramsay looked tired, and Lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing.\n","Processing asent: But now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his boots, or his knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, and his face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration in it which alarmed her, and made her pull her skirts about her.\n","Processing asent: And then, she recalled, there was that sudden revivification, that sudden flare (when she praised his boots), that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things, which too passed and changed (for he was always changing, and hid nothing) into that other final phase which was new to her and had, she owned, made herself ashamed of her own irritability, when it seemed as if he had shed worries and ambitions, and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise, had entered some other region, was drawn on, as if by curiosity, in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or another, at the head of that little procession out of one's range.\n","Processing asent: An extraordinary face!\n","Processing asent: The gate banged.\n","Processing asent: So they're gone, she thought, sighing with relief and disappointment.\n","Processing asent: Her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her, like a bramble sprung across her face.\n","Processing asent: She felt curiously divided, as if one part of her were drawn out thereit was a still day, hazy; the Lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance; the other had fixed itself doggedly, solidly, here on the lawn.\n","Processing asent: She saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her.\n","Processing asent: It seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation; this folly and waste of emotion; it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a peace, as her disorderly sensations (he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing) trooped off the field; and then, emptiness.\n","Processing asent: She looked blankly at the canvas, with its uncompromising white stare; from the canvas to the garden.\n","Processing asent: There was something (she stood screwing up her little Chinese eyes in her small puckered face), something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across, slicing down, and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns, which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along the Brompton Road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself painting that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the knot in imagination.\n","Processing asent: But there was all the difference in the world between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush and making the first mark.\n","Processing asent: She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at Mr. Ramsay's presence, and her easel, rammed into the earth so nervously, was at the wrong angle.\n","Processing asent: And now that she had ut that right, and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person, had such and such relations to people, she took her hand and raised her brush.\n","Processing asent: For a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air.\n","Processing asent: Where to begin?that was the question at what point to make the first mark?\n","Processing asent: One line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks, to frequent and irrevocable decisions.\n","Processing asent: All that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex; as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests.\n","Processing asent: Still the risk must be run; the mark made.\n","Processing asent: With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back, she made her first quick decisive stroke.\n","Processing asent: The brush descended.\n","Processing asent: It flickered brown over the white canvas; it left a running mark.\n","Processing asent: A second time she did ita third time.\n","Processing asent: And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed ( she felt it looming out at her) a space.\n","Processing asent: Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her.\n","Processing asent: For what could be more formidable than that space?\n","Processing asent: Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hersthis other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention.\n","Processing asent: She was half unwilling, half reluctant.\n","Processing asent: Why always be drawn out and haled away?\n","Processing asent: Why not left in peace, to talk to Mr. Carmichael on the lawn?\n","Processing asent: It was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow.\n","Processing asent: Other worshipful objects were content with worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted.\n","Processing asent: Always (it was in her nature, or in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt.\n","Processing asent: Why then did she do it?\n","Processing asent: She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines.\n","Processing asent: It would be hung in the servants' bedrooms.\n","Processing asent: It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa.\n","Processing asent: What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she couldn't paint, saying she couldn't create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them.\n","Processing asent: Can't paint, can't write, she murmured monotonously, anxiously considering what her plan of attack should be.\n","Processing asent: For the mass loomed before her; it protruded; she felt it pressing on her eyeballs.\n","Processing asent: Then, as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted, she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers, moving her brush hither and thither, but it was now heavier and went slower, as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her (she kept looking at the hedge, at the canvas) by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current.\n","Processing asent: Certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things.\n","Processing asent: And as she lost consciousness of outer things, and her name and her personality and her appearance, and whether Mr. Carmichael was there or not, her mind kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings, and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring, hideously difficult white space, while she modelled it with greens and blues.\n","Processing asent: Charles Tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't paint, can't write.\n","Processing asent: Coming up behind her, he had stood close beside her, a thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot.\n","Processing asent: \"Shag tobacco,\" he said, \"fivepence an ounce,\" parading his poverty, his principles.\n","Processing asent: (But the war had drawn the sting of her femininity. Poor devils, one thought, poor devils, of both sexes.)\n","Processing asent: He was always carrying a book about under his arma purple book.\n","Processing asent: He \"worked.\"\n","Processing asent: He sat, she remembered, working in a blaze of sun.\n","Processing asent: At dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view.\n","Processing asent: But after all, she reflected, there was the scene on the beach.\n","Processing asent: One must remember that.\n","Processing asent: It was a windy morning.\n","Processing asent: They had all gone down to the beach.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock.\n","Processing asent: She wrote and wrote.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh,\" she said, looking up at something floating in the sea, \"is it a lobster pot? Is it an upturned boat?\"\n","Processing asent: She was so short-sighted that she could not see, and then Charles Tansley became as nice as he could possibly be.\n","Processing asent: He began playing ducks and drakes.\n","Processing asent: They chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves.\n","Processing asent: Every now and then Mrs. Ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them.\n","Processing asent: What they said she could not remember, but only she and Charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and Mrs. Ramsay watching them.\n","Processing asent: She was highly conscious of that.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay, she thought, stepping back and screwing up her eyes.\n","Processing asent: (It must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with James. There must have been a shadow.)\n","Processing asent: When she thought of herself and Charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach, it seemed to depend somehow upon Mrs. Ramsay sitting under the rock, with a pad on her knee, writing letters.\n","Processing asent: (She wrote innumerable letters, and sometimes the wind took them and she and Charles just saved a page from the sea.)\n","Processing asent: But what a power was in the human soul! she thought.\n","Processing asent: That woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity; made these angers, irritations fall off like old rags; she brought together this and that and then this, and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite (she and Charles squabbling, sparring, had been silly and spiteful) somethingthis scene on the beach for example, this moment of friendship and likingwhich survived, after all these years complete, so that she dipped into it to re-fashion her memory of him, and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art.\n","Processing asent: \"Like a work of art,\" she repeated, looking from her canvas to the drawing-room steps and back again.\n","Processing asent: She must rest for a moment.\n","Processing asent: And, resting, looking from one to the other vaguely, the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually, the vast, the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these, when she released faculties that had been on the strain, stood over her, paused over her, darkened over her.\n","Processing asent: What is the meaning of life?\n","Processing asent: That was alla simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years.\n","Processing asent: The great revelation had never come.\n","Processing asent: The great revelation perhaps never did come.\n","Processing asent: Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.\n","Processing asent: This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs. Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs. Ramsay saying, \"Life stand still here\"; Mrs. Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent)this was of the nature of a revelation.\n","Processing asent: In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability.\n","Processing asent: Life stand still here, Mrs. Ramsay said.\n","Processing asent: \"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\" she repeated.\n","Processing asent: She owed it all to her.\n","Processing asent: All was silence.\n","Processing asent: Nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house.\n","Processing asent: She looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves.\n","Processing asent: The faint thought she was thinking of Mrs. Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this smoke; this fine early morning air.\n","Processing asent: Faint and unreal, it was amazingly pure and exciting.\n","Processing asent: She hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go on painting.\n","Processing asent: She turned to her canvas.\n","Processing asent: But impelled by some curiosity, driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged, she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down there on the beach, she could see that little company setting sail.\n","Processing asent: Down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails furled, some slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one rather apart from the others.\n","Processing asent: The sail was even now being hoisted.\n","Processing asent: She decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat Mr. Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James.\n","Processing asent: Now they had got the sail up; now after a little flagging and silence, she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea.\n","Processing asent: The sails flapped over their heads.\n","Processing asent: The water chuckled and slapped the sides of the boat, which drowsed motionless in the sun.\n","Processing asent: Now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over them and ceased.\n","Processing asent: The boat made no motion at all.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay sat in the middle of the boat.\n","Processing asent: He would be impatient in a moment, James thought, and Cam thought, looking at her father, who sat in the middle of the boat between them (James steered; Cam sat alone in the bow) with his legs tightly curled.\n","Processing asent: He hated hanging about.\n","Processing asent: Sure enough, after fidgeting a second or two, he said something sharp to Macalister's boy, who got out his oars and began to row.\n","Processing asent: But their father, they knew, would never be content until they were flying along.\n","Processing asent: He would keep looking for a breeze, fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which Macalister and and Macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both be made horribly uncomfortable.\n","Processing asent: He had made them come.\n","Processing asent: He had forced them to come.\n","Processing asent: In their anger they hoped that the breeze would never rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had forced them to come against their wills.\n","Processing asent: All the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together, though he bade them \"Walk up, walk up,\" without speaking.\n","Processing asent: Their heads were bent down, their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale.\n","Processing asent: Speak to him they could not.\n","Processing asent: They must come; they must follow.\n","Processing asent: They must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels.\n","Processing asent: But they vowed, in silence, as they walked, to stand by each other and carry out the great compactto resist tyranny to the death.\n","Processing asent: So there they would sit, one at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence.\n","Processing asent: They would say nothing, only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs twisted, frowning and fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze.\n","Processing asent: And they hoped it would be calm.\n","Processing asent: They hoped he would be thwarted.\n","Processing asent: They hoped the whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with their parcels, to the beach.\n","Processing asent: But now, when Macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and shot off.\n","Processing asent: Instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, Mr. Ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a little grunt to Macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered, perfectly content.\n","Processing asent: Now they would sail on for hours like this, and Mr. Ramsay would ask old Macalister a questionabout the great storm last winter probablyand old Macalister would answer it, and they would puff their pipes together, and Macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and never say a word to any one.\n","Processing asent: James would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail.\n","Processing asent: For if he forgot, then the sail puckered and shivered, and the boat slackened, and Mr. Ramsay would say sharply, \"Look out! Look out!\" and old Macalister would turn slowly on his seat.\n","Processing asent: So they heard Mr. Ramsay asking some question about the great storm at Christmas.\n","Processing asent: \"She comes driving round the point,\" old Macalister said, describing the great storm last Christmas, when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen \"one there, one there, one there\" (he pointed slowly round the bay. Mr. Ramsay followed him, turning his head).\n","Processing asent: He had seen four men clinging to the mast.\n","Processing asent: Then she was gone.\n","Processing asent: \"And at last we shoved her off,\" he went on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there, sitting at opposite ends of the boat, united by their compact to fight tyranny to the death).\n","Processing asent: At last they had shoved her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got her out past the pointMacalister told the story; and though they only caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time of their fatherhow he leant forward, how he brought his voice into tune with Macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking there and there where Macalister pointed, he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there.\n","Processing asent: He liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night; pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind; he liked men to work like that, and women to keep house, and sit beside sleeping children indoors, while men were drowned, out there in a storm.\n","Processing asent: So James could tell, so Cam could tell (they looked at him, they looked at each other), from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice, and the little tinge of Scottish accent which came into his voice, making him seem like a peasant himself, as he questioned Macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm.\n","Processing asent: Three had sunk.\n","Processing asent: He looked proudly where Macalister pointed; and Cam thought, feeling proud of him without knowing quite why, had he been there he would have launched the lifeboat, he would have reached the wreck, Cam thought.\n","Processing asent: He was so brave, he was so adventurous, Cam thought.\n","Processing asent: But she remembered.\n","Processing asent: There was the compact; to resist tyranny to the death.\n","Processing asent: Their grievance weighed them down.\n","Processing asent: They had been forced; they had been bidden.\n","Processing asent: He had borne them down once more with his gloom and his authority, making them do his bidding, on this fine morning, come, because he wished it, carrying these parcels, to the Lighthouse; take part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of dead people, which they hated, so that they lagged after him, all the pleasure of the day was spoilt.\n","Processing asent: Yes, the breeze was freshening.\n","Processing asent: The boat was leaning, the water was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades, in bubbles, in cataracts.\n","Processing asent: Cam looked down into the foam, into the sea with all its treasure in it, and its speed hypnotised her, and the tie between her and James sagged a little.\n","Processing asent: It slackened a little.\n","Processing asent: She began to think, How fast it goes.\n","Processing asent: Where are we going?\n","Processing asent: and the movement hypnotised her, while James, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered grimly.\n","Processing asent: But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he might be quit of it all.\n","Processing asent: They might land somewhere; and be free then.\n","Processing asent: Both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the speed and the change.\n","Processing asent: But the breeze bred in Mr. Ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old Macalister turned to fling his line overboard, he cried out aloud,\n","Processing asent: \"We perished,\" and then again, \"each alone.\"\n","Processing asent: And then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand towards the shore.\n","Processing asent: \"See the little house,\" he said pointing, wishing Cam to look.\n","Processing asent: She raised herself reluctantly and looked.\n","Processing asent: But which was it?\n","Processing asent: She could no longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their house.\n","Processing asent: All looked distant and peaceful and strange.\n","Processing asent: The shore seemed refined, far away, unreal.\n","Processing asent: Already the little distance they had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look, the composed look, of something receding in which one has no longer any part.\n","Processing asent: Which was their house?\n","Processing asent: She could not see it.\n","Processing asent: \"But I beneath a rougher sea,\" Mr. Ramsay murmured.\n","Processing asent: He had found the house and so seeing it, he had also seen himself there; he had seen himself walking on the terrace, alone.\n","Processing asent: He was walking up and down between the urns; and he seemed to himself very old and bowed.\n","Processing asent: Sitting in the boat, he bowed, he crouched himself, acting instantly his part the part of a desolate man, widowed, bereft; and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him; staged for himself as he sat in the boat, a little drama; which required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow (he raised his hands and looked at the thinness of them, to confirm his dream) and then there was given him in abundance women's sympathy, and he imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him, and so getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure women's sympathy was to him, he sighed and said gently and mournfully:\n","Processing asent: But I beneath a rougher sea Was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he,\n","Processing asent: so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all.\n","Processing asent: Cam half started on her seat.\n","Processing asent: It shocked herit outraged her.\n","Processing asent: The movement roused her father; and he shuddered, and broke off, exclaiming: \"Look! Look!\" so urgently that James also turned his head to look over his shoulder at the island.\n","Processing asent: They all looked.\n","Processing asent: They looked at the island.\n","Processing asent: But Cam could see nothing.\n","Processing asent: She was thinking how all those paths and the lawn, thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there, were gone: were rubbed out; were past; were unreal, and now this was real; the boat and the sail with its patch; Macalister with his earrings; the noise of the wavesall this was real.\n","Processing asent: Thinking this, she was murmuring to herself, \"We perished, each alone,\" for her father's words broke and broke again in her mind, when her father, seeing her gazing so vaguely, began to tease her.\n","Processing asent: Didn't she know the points of the compass?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: Didn't she know the North from the South?\n","Processing asent: Did she really think they lived right out there?\n","Processing asent: And he pointed again, and showed her where their house was, there, by those trees.\n","Processing asent: He wished she would try to be more accurate, he said: \"Tell mewhich is East, which is West?\" he said, half laughing at her, half scolding her, for he could not understand the state of mind of any one, not absolutely imbecile, who did not know the points of the compass.\n","Processing asent: Yet she did not know.\n","Processing asent: And seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened, eyes fixed where no house was Mr. Ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were stretched out to him.\n","Processing asent: He thought, women are always like that; the vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been able to understand; but so it was.\n","Processing asent: It had been so with herhis wife.\n","Processing asent: They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds.\n","Processing asent: But he had been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this vagueness in women?\n","Processing asent: It was part of their extraordinary charm.\n","Processing asent: I will make her smile at me, he thought.\n","Processing asent: She looks frightened.\n","Processing asent: She was so silent.\n","Processing asent: He clutched his fingers, and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves.\n","Processing asent: He would make her smile at him.\n","Processing asent: He would find some simple easy thing to say to her.\n","Processing asent: But what?\n","Processing asent: For, wrapped up in his work as he was, he forgot the sort of thing one said.\n","Processing asent: There was a puppy.\n","Processing asent: They had a puppy.\n","Processing asent: Who was looking after the puppy today?\n","Processing asent: he asked.\n","Processing asent: Yes, thought James pitilessly, seeing his sister's head against the sail, now she will give way.\n","Processing asent: I shall be left to fight the tyrant alone.\n","Processing asent: The compact would be left to him to carry out.\n","Processing asent: Cam would never resist tyranny to the death, he thought grimly, watching her face, sad, sulky, yielding.\n","Processing asent: And as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding hills is gloom and sorrow, and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded, the darkened, either in pity, or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay: so Cam now felt herself overcast, as she sat there among calm, resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy; how to resist his entreatyforgive me, care for me; while James the lawgiver, with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee (his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her), said, Resist him.\n","Processing asent: Fight him.\n","Processing asent: He said so rightly; justly.\n","Processing asent: For they must fight tyranny to the death, she thought.\n","Processing asent: Of all human qualities she reverenced justice most.\n","Processing asent: Her brother was most god-like, her father most suppliant.\n","Processing asent: And to which did she yield, she thought, sitting between them, gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her, and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there.\n","Processing asent: \"Jasper,\" she said sullenly.\n","Processing asent: He'd look after the puppy.\n","Processing asent: And what was she going to call him?\n","Processing asent: her father persisted.\n","Processing asent: He had had a dog when he was a little boy, called Frisk.\n","Processing asent: She'll give way, James thought, as he watched a look come upon her face, a look he remembered.\n","Processing asent: They look down he thought, at their knitting or something.\n","Processing asent: Then suddenly they look up.\n","Processing asent: There was a flash of blue, he remembered, and then somebody sitting with him laughed, surrendered, and he was very angry.\n","Processing asent: It must have been his mother, he thought, sitting on a low chair, with his father standing over her.\n","Processing asent: He began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down, leaf upon leaf, fold upon fold softly, incessantly upon his brain; among scents, sounds; voices, harsh, hollow, sweet; and lights passing, and brooms tapping; and the wash and hush of the sea, how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead, upright, over them.\n","Processing asent: Meanwhile, he noticed, Cam dabbled her fingers in the water, and stared at the shore and said nothing.\n","Processing asent: No, she won't give way, he thought; she's different, he thought.\n","Processing asent: Well, if Cam would not answer him, he would not bother her Mr. Ramsay decided, feeling in his pocket for a book.\n","Processing asent: But she would answer him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say, Oh, yes, Frisk.\n","Processing asent: I'll call him Frisk.\n","Processing asent: She wanted even to say, Was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone?\n","Processing asent: But try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that, fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father, unsuspected by James, a private token of the love she felt for him.\n","Processing asent: For she thought, dabbling her hand (and now Macalister's boy had caught a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills) for she thought, looking at James who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this extraordinary temptation.\n","Processing asent: Her father was feeling in his pockets; in another second, he would have found his book.\n","Processing asent: For no one attracted her more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and his words, and his haste, and his temper, and his oddity, and his passion, and his saying straight out before every one, we perish, each alone, and his remoteness.\n","Processing asent: (He had opened his book.)\n","Processing asent: But what remained intolerable, she thought, sitting upright, and watching Macalister's boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: \"Do this,\" \"Do that,\" his dominance: his \"Submit to me.\"\n","Processing asent: So she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore, wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen asleep, she thought; were free like smoke, were free to come and go like ghosts.\n","Processing asent: They have no suffering there, she thought.\n","Processing asent: Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, standing on the edge of the lawn.\n","Processing asent: It was the boat with greyish-brown sails, which she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay.\n","Processing asent: There he sits, she thought, and the children are quite silent still.\n","Processing asent: And she could not reach him either.\n","Processing asent: The sympathy she had not given him weighed her down.\n","Processing asent: It made it difficult for her to paint.\n","Processing asent: She had always found him difficult.\n","Processing asent: She never had been able to praise him to his face, she remembered.\n","Processing asent: And that reduced their relationship to something neutral, without that element of sex in it which made his manner to Minta so gallant, almost gay.\n","Processing asent: He would pick a flower for her, lend her his books.\n","Processing asent: But could he believe that Minta read them?\n","Processing asent: She dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the place.\n","Processing asent: \"D'you remember, Mr. Carmichael?\" she was inclined to ask, looking at the old man.\n","Processing asent: But he had pulled his hat half over his forehead; he was asleep, or he was dreaming, or he was lying there catching words, she supposed.\n","Processing asent: \"D'you remember?\" she felt inclined to ask him as she passed him, thinking again of Mrs. Ramsay on the beach; the cask bobbing up and down; and the pages flying.\n","Processing asent: Why, after all these years had that survived, ringed round, lit up, visible to the last detail, with all before it blank and all after it blank, for miles and miles?\n","Processing asent: \"Is it a boat? Is it a cork?\" she would say, Lily repeated, turning back, reluctantly again, to her canvas.\n","Processing asent: Heaven be praised for it, the problem of space remained, she thought, taking up her brush again.\n","Processing asent: It glared at her.\n","Processing asent: The whole mass of the picture was poised upon that weight.\n","Processing asent: Beautiful and bright it should be on the surface, feathery and evanescent, one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron.\n","Processing asent: It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses.\n","Processing asent: And she began to lay on a red, a grey, and she began to model her way into the hollow there.\n","Processing asent: At the same time, she seemed to be sitting beside Mrs. Ramsay on the beach.\n","Processing asent: \"Is it a boat? Is it a cask?\"\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay said.\n","Processing asent: And she began hunting round for her spectacles.\n","Processing asent: And she sat, having found them, silent, looking out to sea.\n","Processing asent: And Lily, painting steadily, felt as if a door had opened, and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high cathedral-like place, very dark, very solemn.\n","Processing asent: Shouts came from a world far away.\n","Processing asent: Steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon.\n","Processing asent: Charles threw stones and sent them skipping.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay sat silent.\n","Processing asent: She was glad, Lily thought, to rest in silence, uncommunicative; to rest in the extreme obscurity of human relationships.\n","Processing asent: Who knows what we are, what we feel?\n","Processing asent: Who knows even at the moment of intimacy, This is knowledge?\n","Processing asent: Aren't things spoilt then, Mrs. Ramsay may have asked (it seemed to have happened so often, this silence by her side) by saying them?\n","Processing asent: Aren't we more expressive thus?\n","Processing asent: The moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile.\n","Processing asent: She rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up, by way of burying in it the perfection of the moment.\n","Processing asent: It was like a drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of the past.\n","Processing asent: Lily stepped back to get her canvassointo perspective.\n","Processing asent: It was an odd road to be walking, this of painting.\n","Processing asent: Out and out one went, further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank, perfectly alone, over the sea.\n","Processing asent: And as she dipped into the blue paint, she dipped too into the past there.\n","Processing asent: Now Mrs. Ramsay got up, she remembered.\n","Processing asent: It was time to go back to the housetime for luncheon.\n","Processing asent: And they all walked up from the beach together, she walking behind with William Bankes, and there was Minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking.\n","Processing asent: How that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them!\n","Processing asent: How William Bankes deplored it, without, so far as she could remember, saying anything about it!\n","Processing asent: It meant to him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants leaving and beds not made at mid-dayall the things he most abhorred.\n","Processing asent: He had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did nowholding his hand in front of him.\n","Processing asent: And Minta walked on ahead, and presumably Paul met her and she went off with Paul in the garden.\n","Processing asent: The Rayleys, thought Lily Briscoe, squeezing her tube of green paint.\n","Processing asent: She collected her impressions of the Rayleys.\n","Processing asent: Their lives appeared to her in a series of scenes; one, on the staircase at dawn.\n","Processing asent: Paul had come in and gone to bed early; Minta was late.\n","Processing asent: There was Minta, wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three o'clock in the morning.\n","Processing asent: Paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars.\n","Processing asent: Minta was eating a sandwich, standing half-way up by a window, in the cadaverous early morning light, and the carpet had a hole in it.\n","Processing asent: But what did they say?\n","Processing asent: Lily asked herself, as if by looking she could hear them.\n","Processing asent: Minta went on eating her sandwich, annoyingly, while he spoke something violent, abusing her, in a mutter so as not to wake the children, the two little boys.\n","Processing asent: He was withered, drawn; she flamboyant, careless.\n","Processing asent: For things had worked loose after the first year or so; the marriage had turned out rather badly.\n","Processing asent: And this, Lily thought, taking the green paint on her brush, this making up scenes about them, is what we call \"knowing\" people, \"thinking\" of them, \"being fond\" of them!\n","Processing asent: Not a word of it was true; she had made it up; but it was what she knew them by all the same.\n","Processing asent: She went on tunnelling her way into her picture, into the past.\n","Processing asent: Another time, Paul said he \"played chess in coffee-houses.\"\n","Processing asent: She had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too.\n","Processing asent: She remembered how, as he said it, she thought how he rang up the servant, and she said, \"Mrs. Rayley's out, sir,\" and he decided that he would not come home either.\n","Processing asent: She saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats, and the waitresses got to know you, and he played chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at Surbiton, but that was all Paul knew about him.\n","Processing asent: And then Minta was out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs, when he got the poker in case of burglars (no doubt to frighten her too) and spoke so bitterly, saying she had ruined his life.\n","Processing asent: At any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near Rickmansworth, things were horribly strained.\n","Processing asent: Paul took her down the garden to look at the Belgian hares which he bred, and Minta followed them, singing, and put her bare arm on his shoulder, lest he should tell her anything.\n","Processing asent: Minta was bored by hares, Lily thought.\n","Processing asent: But Minta never gave herself away.\n","Processing asent: She never said things like that about playing chess in coffee- houses.\n","Processing asent: She was far too conscious, far too wary.\n","Processing asent: But to go on with their storythey had got through the dangerous stage by now.\n","Processing asent: She had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and Minta had to hand him his tools.\n","Processing asent: He sat on the road mending the car, and it was the way she gave him the toolsbusiness-like, straightforward, friendlythat proved it was all right now.\n","Processing asent: They were \"in love\" no longer; no, he had taken up with another woman, a serious woman, with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand (Minta had described her gratefully, almost admiringly), who went to meetings and shared Paul's views (they had got more and more pronounced) about the taxation of land values and a capital levy.\n","Processing asent: Far from breaking up the marriage, that alliance had righted it.\n","Processing asent: They were excellent friends, obviously, as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools.\n","Processing asent: So that was the story of the Rayleys, Lily thought.\n","Processing asent: She imagined herself telling it to Mrs. Ramsay, who would be full of curiosity to know what had become of the Rayleys.\n","Processing asent: She would feel a little triumphant, telling Mrs. Ramsay that the marriage had not been a success.\n","Processing asent: But the dead, thought Lily, encountering some obstacle in her design which made her pause and ponder, stepping back a foot or so, oh, the dead! she murmured, one pitied them, one brushed them aside, one had even a little contempt for them.\n","Processing asent: They are at our mercy.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay has faded and gone, she thought.\n","Processing asent: We can over-ride her wishes, improve away her limited, old-fashioned ideas.\n","Processing asent: She recedes further and further from us.\n","Processing asent: Mockingly she seemed to see her there at the end of the corridor of years saying, of all incongruous things, \"Marry, marry!\" (sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to cheep in the garden outside).\n","Processing asent: And one would have to say to her, It has all gone against your wishes.\n","Processing asent: They're happy like that; I'm happy like this.\n","Processing asent: Life has changed completely.\n","Processing asent: At that all her being, even her beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date.\n","Processing asent: For a moment Lily, standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the Rayleys, triumphed over Mrs. Ramsay, who would never know how Paul went to coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and Minta handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married, not even William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsay had planned it.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps, had she lived, she would have compelled it.\n","Processing asent: Already that summer he was \"the kindest of men.\"\n","Processing asent: He was \"the first scientist of his age, my husband says.\"\n","Processing asent: He was also \"poor Williamit makes me so unhappy, when I go to see him, to find nothing nice in his houseno one to arrange the flowers.\"\n","Processing asent: So they were sent for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony that made Mrs. Ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact.\n","Processing asent: What was this mania of hers for marriage?\n","Processing asent: Lily wondered, stepping to and fro from her easel.\n","Processing asent: (Suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish light seemed to burn in her mind, covering Paul Rayley, issuing from him. It rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a distant beach. She heard the roar and the crackle. The whole sea for miles round ran red and gold. Some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her, for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a beach. And the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and disgust, as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house, greedily, disgustingly, and she loathed it. But for a sight, for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience, and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea, and one had only to say \"in love\" and instantly, as happened now, up rose Paul's fire again. And it sank and she said to herself, laughing, \"The Rayleys\"; how Paul went to coffee-houses and played chess.)\n","Processing asent: She had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she thought.\n","Processing asent: She had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody, and she had felt an enormous exultation.\n","Processing asent: She had felt, now she could stand up to Mrs. Ramsaya tribute to the astonishing power that Mrs. Ramsay had over one.\n","Processing asent: Do this, she said, and one did it.\n","Processing asent: Even her shadow at the window with James was full of authority.\n","Processing asent: She remembered how William Bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son.\n","Processing asent: Did she not admire their beauty?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: But William, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed a shadow there and so on.\n","Processing asent: She did not intend to disparage a subject which, they agreed, Raphael had treated divinely.\n","Processing asent: She was not cynical.\n","Processing asent: Quite the contrary.\n","Processing asent: Thanks to his scientific mind he understooda proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted her enormously.\n","Processing asent: One could talk of painting then seriously to a man.\n","Processing asent: Indeed, his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life.\n","Processing asent: She loved William Bankes.\n","Processing asent: They went to Hampton Court and he always left her, like the perfect gentleman he was, plenty of time to wash her hands, while he strolled by the river.\n","Processing asent: That was typical of their relationship.\n","Processing asent: Many things were left unsaid.\n","Processing asent: Then they strolled through the courtyards, and admired, summer after summer, the proportions and the flowers, and he would tell her things, about perspective, about architecture, as they walked, and he would stop to look at a tree, or the view over the lake, and admire a child(it was his great griefhe had no daughter) in the vague aloof way that was natural to a man who spent spent so much time in laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him, so that he walked slowly, lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused, with his head thrown back, merely to breathe the air.\n","Processing asent: Then he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday; he must buy a new carpet for the staircase.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps she would go with him to buy a new carpet for the staircase.\n","Processing asent: And once something led him to talk about the Ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been wearing a grey hat; she was not more than nineteen or twenty.\n","Processing asent: She was astonishingly beautiful.\n","Processing asent: There he stood looking down the avenue at Hampton Court as if he could see her there among the fountains.\n","Processing asent: She looked now at the drawing-room step.\n","Processing asent: She saw, through William's eyes, the shape of a woman, peaceful and silent, with downcast eyes.\n","Processing asent: She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, Lily thought).\n","Processing asent: Her eyes were bent.\n","Processing asent: She would never lift them.\n","Processing asent: Yes, thought Lily, looking intently, I must have seen her look like that, but not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful.\n","Processing asent: The figure came readily enough.\n","Processing asent: She was astonishingly beautiful, as William said.\n","Processing asent: But beauty was not everything.\n","Processing asent: Beauty had this penaltyit came too readily, came too completely.\n","Processing asent: It stilled lifefroze it.\n","Processing asent: One forgot the little agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer distortion, some light or shadow, which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after.\n","Processing asent: It was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty.\n","Processing asent: But what was the look she had, Lily wondered, when she clapped her deer-stalkers's hat on her head, or ran across the grass, or scolded Kennedy, the gardener?\n","Processing asent: Who could tell her?\n","Processing asent: Who could help her?\n","Processing asent: Against her will she had come to the surface, and found herself half out of the picture, looking, little dazedly, as if at unreal things, at Mr. Carmichael.\n","Processing asent: He lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch not reading, or sleeping, but basking like a creature gorged with existence.\n","Processing asent: His book had fallen on to the grass.\n","Processing asent: She wanted to go straight up to him and say, \"Mr. Carmichael!\"\n","Processing asent: Then he would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague green eyes.\n","Processing asent: But one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them.\n","Processing asent: And she wanted to say not one thing, but everything.\n","Processing asent: Little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing.\n","Processing asent: \"About life, about death; about Mrs. Ramsay\"no, she thought, one could say nothing to nobody.\n","Processing asent: The urgency of the moment always missed its mark.\n","Processing asent: Words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low.\n","Processing asent: Then one gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became like most middle-aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension.\n","Processing asent: For how could one express in words these emotions of the body?\n","Processing asent: express that emptiness there?\n","Processing asent: (She was looking at the drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily empty.)\n","Processing asent: It was one's body feeling, not one's mind.\n","Processing asent: The physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant.\n","Processing asent: To want and not to have, sent all up her body a hardness, a hollowness, a strain.\n","Processing asent: And then to want and not to haveto want and wanthow that wrung the heart, and wrung it again and again!\n","Processing asent: Oh, Mrs. Ramsay! she called out silently, to that essence which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come back again.\n","Processing asent: It had seemed so safe, thinking of her.\n","Processing asent: Ghost, air, nothingness, a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time of day or night, she had been that, and then suddenly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly, the empty drawing-room steps, the frill of the chair inside, the puppy tumbling on the terrace, the whole wave and whisper of the garden became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness.\n","Processing asent: \"What does it mean? How do you explain it all?\" she wanted to say, turning to Mr. Carmichael again.\n","Processing asent: For the whole world seemed to have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought, a deep basin of reality, and one could almost fancy that had Mr. Carmichael spoken, for instance, a little tear would have rent the surface pool.\n","Processing asent: And then?\n","Processing asent: Something would emerge.\n","Processing asent: A hand would be shoved up, a blade would be flashed.\n","Processing asent: It was nonsense of course.\n","Processing asent: A curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the things she could not say.\n","Processing asent: He was an inscrutable old man, with the yellow stain on his beard, and his poetry, and his puzzles, sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants, so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted.\n","Processing asent: She looked at her picture.\n","Processing asent: That would have been his answer, presumablyhow \"you\" and \"I\" and \"she\" pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint.\n","Processing asent: Yet it would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa; yet even so, even of a picture like that, it was true.\n","Processing asent: One might say, even of this scrawl, not of that actual picture, perhaps, but of what it attempted, that it \"remained for ever,\" she was going to say, or, for the words spoken sounded even to herself, too boastful, to hint, wordlessly; when, looking at the picture, she was surprised to find that she could not see it.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did not think of tears at first) which, without disturbing the firmness of her lips, made the air thick, rolled down her cheeks.\n","Processing asent: She had perfect control of herselfOh, yes!in every other way.\n","Processing asent: Was she crying then for Mrs. Ramsay, without being aware of any unhappiness?\n","Processing asent: She addressed old Mr. Carmichael again.\n","Processing asent: What was it then?\n","Processing asent: What did it mean?\n","Processing asent: Could things thrust their hands up and grip one; could the blade cut; the fist grasp?\n","Processing asent: Was there no safety?\n","Processing asent: No learning by heart of the ways of the world?\n","Processing asent: No guide, no shelter, but all was miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air?\n","Processing asent: Could it be, even for elderly people, that this was life?startling, unexpected, unknown?\n","Processing asent: For one moment she felt that if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and demanded an explanation, why was it so short, why was it so inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll itself up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into shape; if they shouted loud enough Mrs. Ramsay would return.\n","Processing asent: \"Mrs. Ramsay!\" she said aloud, \"Mrs. Ramsay!\"\n","Processing asent: The tears ran down her face.\n","Processing asent: [Macalister's boy took one of the fish and cut a square out of its side to bait his hook with. The mutilated body (it was alive still) was thrown back into the sea.]\n","Processing asent: \"Mrs. Ramsay!\"\n","Processing asent: Lily cried, \"Mrs. Ramsay!\"\n","Processing asent: But nothing happened.\n","Processing asent: The pain increased.\n","Processing asent: That anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of imbecility, she thought!\n","Processing asent: Anyhow the old man had not heard her.\n","Processing asent: He remained benignant, calmif one chose to think it, sublime.\n","Processing asent: Heaven be praised, no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry, stop pain, stop!\n","Processing asent: She had not obviously taken leave of her senses.\n","Processing asent: No one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation.\n","Processing asent: She remained a skimpy old maid, holding a paint-brush.\n","Processing asent: And now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be called back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for Mrs. Ramsay again. Had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast? not in the least) lessened; and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief that was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously, a sense of some one there, of Mrs. Ramsay, relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her, staying lightly by her side and then (for this was Mrs. Ramsay in all her beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went.\n","Processing asent: Lily squeezed her tubes again.\n","Processing asent: She attacked that problem of the hedge.\n","Processing asent: It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinth or lilies, she vanished.\n","Processing asent: It was some trick of the painter's eye.\n","Processing asent: For days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion, a shade across the fields.\n","Processing asent: The sight, the phrase, had its power to console.\n","Processing asent: Wherever she happened to be, painting, here, in the country or in London, the vision would come to her, and her eyes, half closing, sought something to base her vision on.\n","Processing asent: She looked down the railway carriage, the omnibus; took a line from shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows opposite; at Piccadilly, lamp-strung in the evening.\n","Processing asent: All had been part of the fields of death.\n","Processing asent: But always somethingit might be a face, a voice, a paper boy crying STANDARD, NEWSthrust through, snubbed her, waked her, required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that the vision must be perpetually remade.\n","Processing asent: Now again, moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay beneath her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves, and stony fields of the purpler spaces, again she was roused as usual by something incongruous.\n","Processing asent: There was a brown spot in the middle of the bay.\n","Processing asent: It was a boat.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she realised that after a second.\n","Processing asent: But whose boat?\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay's boat, she replied.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay; the man who had marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which she had refused.\n","Processing asent: The boat was now half way across the bay.\n","Processing asent: So fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric, as if sails were stuck high up in the sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the sea.\n","Processing asent: A steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively, as if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh, only gently swaying them this way and that.\n","Processing asent: And as happens sometimes when the weather is very fine, the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships, and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs, as if they signalled to each other some message of their own.\n","Processing asent: For sometimes quite close to the shore, the Lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous distance away.\n","Processing asent: \"Where are they now?\"\n","Processing asent: Lily thought, looking out to sea.\n","Processing asent: Where was he, that very old man who had gone past her silently, holding a brown paper parcel under his arm?\n","Processing asent: The boat was in the middle of the bay.\n","Processing asent: They don't feel a thing there, Cam thought, looking at the shore, which, rising and falling, became steadily more distant and more peaceful.\n","Processing asent: Her hand cut a trail in the sea, as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and, numbed and shrouded, wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays, where in the green light a change came over one's entire mind and one's body shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak.\n","Processing asent: Then the eddy slackened round her hand.\n","Processing asent: The rush of the water ceased; the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds.\n","Processing asent: One heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour.\n","Processing asent: Everything became very close to one.\n","Processing asent: For the sail, upon which James had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew, sagged entirely; there they came to a stop, flapping about waiting for a breeze, in the hot sun, miles from shore, miles from the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still.\n","Processing asent: The Lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the distant shore became fixed.\n","Processing asent: The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other's presence, which they had almost forgotten.\n","Processing asent: Macalister's fishing line went plumb down into the sea.\n","Processing asent: But Mr. Ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him.\n","Processing asent: He was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover's egg.\n","Processing asent: Now and again, as they hung about in that horrid calm, he turned a page.\n","Processing asent: And James felt that each page was turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him; now assertively, now commandingly; now with the intention of making people pity him; and all the time, as his father read and turned one after another of those little pages, James kept dreading the moment when he would look up and speak sharply to him about something or other.\n","Processing asent: Why were they lagging about here?\n","Processing asent: he would demand, or something quite unreasonable like that.\n","Processing asent: And if he does, James thought, then I shall take a knife and strike him to the heart.\n","Processing asent: He had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart.\n","Processing asent: Only now, as he grew older, and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage, it was not him, that old man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it was the thing that descended on himwithout his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak all cold and hard, that struck and struck at you (he could feel the beak on his bare legs, where it had struck when he was a child) and then made off, and there he was again, an old man, very sad, reading his book.\n","Processing asent: That he would kill, that he would strike to the heart.\n","Processing asent: Whatever he did(and he might do anything, he felt, looking at the Lighthouse and the distant shore) whether he was in a business, in a bank, a barrister, a man at the head of some enterprise, that he would fight, that he would track down and stamp outtyranny, despotism, he called itmaking people do what they did not want to do, cutting off their right to speak.\n","Processing asent: How could any of them say, But I won't, when he said, Come to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: Do this.\n","Processing asent: Fetch me that.\n","Processing asent: The black wings spread, and the hard beak tore.\n","Processing asent: And then next moment, there he sat reading his book; and he might look upone never knewquite reasonably.\n","Processing asent: He might talk to the Macalisters.\n","Processing asent: He might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman's hand in the street, James thought, and he might be shouting out at some fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement.\n","Processing asent: Or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other.\n","Processing asent: Yes, thought James, while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to feel, quite often lately, when his father said something or did something which surprised the others, there were two pairs of footprints only; his own and his father's.\n","Processing asent: They alone knew each other.\n","Processing asent: What then was this terror, this hatred?\n","Processing asent: Turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him, peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in one's eyes, now with a dark shadow, he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape.\n","Processing asent: Suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some one's knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently, some one's foot?\n","Processing asent: Suppose he had seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole; then the wheel; and the same foot, purple, crushed.\n","Processing asent: But the wheel was innocent.\n","Processing asent: So now, when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the Lighthouse down it came over his foot, over Cam's foot, over anybody's foot.\n","Processing asent: One sat and watched it.\n","Processing asent: But whose foot was he thinking of, and in what garden did all this happen?\n","Processing asent: For one had settings for these scenes; trees that grew there; flowers; a certain light; a few figures.\n","Processing asent: Everything tended to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom.\n","Processing asent: None of this throwing of hands about; people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice.\n","Processing asent: They went in and out all day long.\n","Processing asent: There was an old woman gossiping in the kitchen; and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze; all was blowing, all was growing; and over all those plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn, like a vine leaf, at night.\n","Processing asent: Things became stiller and darker at night.\n","Processing asent: But the leaf-like veil was so fine, that lights lifted it, voices crinkled it; he could see through it a figure stooping, hear, coming close, going away, some dress rustling, some chain tinkling.\n","Processing asent: It was in this world that the wheel went over the person's foot.\n","Processing asent: Something, he remembered, stayed flourished up in the air, something arid and sharp descended even there, like a blade, a scimitar, smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it shrivel and fall.\n","Processing asent: \"It will rain,\" he remembered his father saying.\n","Processing asent: \"You won't be able to go to the Lighthouse.\"\n","Processing asent: The Lighthouse was then a silvery, misty-looking tower with a yellow eye, that opened suddenly, and softly in the evening.\n","Processing asent: James looked at the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: He could see the white-washed rocks; the tower, stark and straight; he could see that it was barred with black and white; he could see windows in it; he could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry.\n","Processing asent: So that was the Lighthouse, was it?\n","Processing asent: No, the other was also the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: For nothing was simply one thing.\n","Processing asent: The other Lighthouse was true too.\n","Processing asent: It was sometimes hardly to be seen across the bay.\n","Processing asent: In the evening one looked up and saw the eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them in that airy sunny garden where they sat.\n","Processing asent: But he pulled himself up.\n","Processing asent: Whenever he said \"they\" or \"a person,\" and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of some one going, he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever might be in the room.\n","Processing asent: It was his father now.\n","Processing asent: The strain was acute.\n","Processing asent: For in one moment if there was no breeze, his father would slap the covers of his book together, and say: \"What's happening now? What are we dawdling about here for, eh?\" as, once before he had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over, and if there had been an axe handy, a knife, or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart.\n","Processing asent: She had gone stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so that he felt she listened to him no longer, she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there, impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping a pair of scissors.\n","Processing asent: Not a breath of wind blew.\n","Processing asent: The water chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them.\n","Processing asent: At any moment Mr. Ramsay (he scarcely dared look at him) might rouse himself, shut his book, and say something sharp; but for the moment he was reading, so that James stealthily, as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet, afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board, went on thinking what was she like, where did she go that day?\n","Processing asent: He began following her from room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light, as if the reflection came from many china dishes, she talked to somebody; he listened to her talking.\n","Processing asent: She talked to a servant, saying simply whatever came into her head.\n","Processing asent: She alone spoke the truth; to her alone could he speak it.\n","Processing asent: That was the source of her everlasting attraction for him, perhaps; she was a person to whom one could say what came into one's head.\n","Processing asent: But all the time he thought of her, he was conscious of his father following his thought, surveying it, making it shiver and falter.\n","Processing asent: At last he ceased to think.\n","Processing asent: There he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun, staring at the Lighthouse, powerless to move, powerless to flick off these grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another.\n","Processing asent: A rope seemed to bind him there, and his father had knotted it and he could only escape by taking a knife and plunging it...But at that moment the sail swung slowly round, filled slowly out, the boat seemed to shake herself, and then to move off half conscious in her sleep, and then she woke and shot through the waves.\n","Processing asent: The relief was extraordinary.\n","Processing asent: They all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their ease, and the fishing-lines slanted taut across the side of the boat.\n","Processing asent: But his father did not rouse himself.\n","Processing asent: He only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air, and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 10\n","Processing asent: [The sea without a stain on it, thought Lily Briscoe, still standing and looking out over the bay. The sea stretched like silk across the bay. Distance had an extraordinary power; they had been swallowed up in it, she felt, they were gone for ever, they had become part of the nature of things. It was so calm; it was so quiet. The steamer itself had vanished, but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction.]\n","Processing asent: SECTION 11\n","Processing asent: It was like that then, the island, thought Cam, once more drawing her fingers through the waves.\n","Processing asent: She had never seen it from out at sea before.\n","Processing asent: It lay like that on the sea, did it, with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags, and the sea swept in there, and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island.\n","Processing asent: It was very small; shaped something like a leaf stood on end.\n","Processing asent: So we took a little boat, she thought, beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship.\n","Processing asent: But with the sea streaming through her fingers, a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them, she did not want to tell herself seriously a story; it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted, for she was thinking, as the boat sailed on, how her father's anger about the points of the compass, James's obstinacy about the compact, and her own anguish, all had slipped, all had passed, all had streamed away.\n","Processing asent: What then came next?\n","Processing asent: Where were they going?\n","Processing asent: From her hand, ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change, at the escape, at the adventure (that she should be alive, that she should be there).\n","Processing asent: And the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark, the slumbrous shapes in her mind; shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness, catching here and there, a spark of light; Greece, Rome, Constantinople.\n","Processing asent: Small as it was, and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold- sprinkled waters flowing in and about it, it had, she supposed, a place in the universeeven that little island?\n","Processing asent: The old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it.\n","Processing asent: There they were (it might be Mr. Carmichael or Mr. Bankes who was sitting with her father) sitting opposite each other in their low arm-chairs.\n","Processing asent: They were crackling in front of them the pages of THE TIMES, when she came in from the garden, all in a muddle, about something some one had said about Christ, or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a London street, or wondering what Napoleon was like.\n","Processing asent: Then they took all this with their clean hands (they wore grey-coloured clothes; they smelt of heather) and they brushed the scraps together, turning the paper, crossing their knees, and said something now and then very brief.\n","Processing asent: Just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there, watching her father write, so equally, so neatly from one side of the page to another, with a little cough now and then, or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite.\n","Processing asent: And she thought, standing there with her book open, one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water; and if it did well here, among the old gentlemen smoking and THE TIMES crackling then it was right.\n","Processing asent: And watching her father as he wrote in his study, she thought (now sitting in the boat) he was not vain, nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him.\n","Processing asent: Indeed, if he saw she was there, reading a book, he would ask her, as gently as any one could, Was there nothing he could give her?\n","Processing asent: Lest this should be wrong, she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover's egg.\n","Processing asent: No; it was right.\n","Processing asent: Look at him now, she wanted to say aloud to James.\n","Processing asent: (But James had his eye on the sail.)\n","Processing asent: He is a sarcastic brute, James would say.\n","Processing asent: He brings the talk round to himself and his books, James would say.\n","Processing asent: He is intolerably egotistical.\n","Processing asent: Worst of all, he is a tyrant.\n","Processing asent: But look! she said, looking at him.\n","Processing asent: Look at him now.\n","Processing asent: She looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled; the little book whose yellowish pages she knew, without knowing what was written on them.\n","Processing asent: It was small; it was closely printed; on the fly-leaf, she knew, he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner; the wine had been so much; he had given so much to the waiter; all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page.\n","Processing asent: But what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket, she did not know.\n","Processing asent: What he thought they none of them knew.\n","Processing asent: But he was absorbed in it, so that when he looked up, as he did now for an instant, it was not to see anything; it was to pin down some thought more exactly.\n","Processing asent: That done, his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading.\n","Processing asent: He read, she thought, as if he were guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing over page after page.\n","Processing asent: And she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship, for she was safe, while he sat there; safe, as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden, and took a book down, and the old gentleman, lowering the paper suddenly, said something very brief over the top of it about the character of Napoleon.\n","Processing asent: She gazed back over the sea, at the island.\n","Processing asent: But the leaf was losing its sharpness.\n","Processing asent: It was very small; it was very distant.\n","Processing asent: The sea was more important now than the shore.\n","Processing asent: Waves were all round them, tossing and sinking, with a log wallowing down one wave; a gull riding on another.\n","Processing asent: About here, she thought, dabbling her fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she murmured, dreamily half asleep, how we perished, each alone.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 12\n","Processing asent: So much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe, looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling for Mr. Ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay.\n","Processing asent: It seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and more remote.\n","Processing asent: He and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand, Mr. Carmichael suddenly grunted.\n","Processing asent: She laughed.\n","Processing asent: He clawed his book up from the grass.\n","Processing asent: He settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster.\n","Processing asent: That was different altogether, because he was so near.\n","Processing asent: And now again all was quiet.\n","Processing asent: They must be out of bed by this time, she supposed, looking at the house, but nothing appeared there.\n","Processing asent: But then, she remembered, they had always made off directly a meal was over, on business of their own.\n","Processing asent: It was all in keeping with this silence, this emptiness, and the unreality of the early morning hour.\n","Processing asent: It was a way things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they became illness, before habits had spun themselves across the surface, one felt that same unreality, which was so startling; felt something emerge.\n","Processing asent: Life was most vivid then.\n","Processing asent: One could be at one's ease.\n","Processing asent: Mercifully one need not say, very briskly, crossing the lawn to greet old Mrs. Beckwith, who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in, \"Oh, good-morning, Mrs. Beckwith! What a lovely day! Are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun? Jasper's hidden the chairs. Do let me find you one!\" and all the rest of the usual chatter.\n","Processing asent: One need not speak at all.\n","Processing asent: One glided, one shook one's sails (there was a good deal of movement in the bay, boats were starting off) between things, beyond things.\n","Processing asent: Empty it was not, but full to the brim.\n","Processing asent: She seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance, to move and float and sink in it, yes, for these waters were unfathomably deep.\n","Processing asent: Into them had spilled so many lives.\n","Processing asent: The Ramsays'; the children's; and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides.\n","Processing asent: A washer-woman with her basket; a rook, a red-hot poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers: some common feeling which held the whole together.\n","Processing asent: It was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which, ten years ago, standing almost where she stood now, had made her say that she must be in love with the place.\n","Processing asent: Love had a thousand shapes.\n","Processing asent: There might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the elements of things and place them together and so, giving them a wholeness not theirs in life, make of some scene, or meeting of people (all now gone and separate), one of those globed compacted things over which thought lingers, and love plays.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes rested on the brown speck of Mr. Ramsay's sailing boat.\n","Processing asent: They would be at the Lighthouse by lunch time she supposed.\n","Processing asent: But the wind had freshened, and, as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed slightly and the boats altered their positions, the view, which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed, was now unsatisfactory.\n","Processing asent: The wind had blown the trail of smoke about; there was something displeasing about the placing of the ships.\n","Processing asent: The disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind.\n","Processing asent: She felt an obscure distress.\n","Processing asent: It was confirmed when she turned to her picture.\n","Processing asent: She had been wasting her morning.\n","Processing asent: For whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite forces; Mr. Ramsay and the picture; which was necessary.\n","Processing asent: There was something perhaps wrong with the design?\n","Processing asent: Was it, she wondered, that the line of the wall wanted breaking, was it that the mass of the trees was too heavy?\n","Processing asent: She smiled ironically; for had she not thought, when she began, that she had solved her problem?\n","Processing asent: What was the problem then?\n","Processing asent: She must try to get hold of something tht evaded her.\n","Processing asent: It evaded her when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay; it evaded her now when she thought of her picture.\n","Processing asent: Phrases came.\n","Processing asent: Visions came.\n","Processing asent: Beautiful pictures.\n","Processing asent: Beautiful phrases.\n","Processing asent: But what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been made anything.\n","Processing asent: Get that and start afresh; get that and start afresh; she said desperately, pitching herself firmly again before her easel.\n","Processing asent: It was a miserable machine, an inefficient machine, she thought, the human apparatus for painting or for feeling; it always broke down at the critical moment; heroically, one must force it on.\n","Processing asent: She stared, frowning.\n","Processing asent: There was the hedge, sure enough.\n","Processing asent: But one got nothing by soliciting urgently.\n","Processing asent: One got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the wall, or from thinkingshe wore a grey hat.\n","Processing asent: She was astonishingly beautiful.\n","Processing asent: Let it come, she thought, if it will come.\n","Processing asent: For there are moments when one can neither think nor feel.\n","Processing asent: And if one can neither think nor feel, she thought, where is one?\n","Processing asent: Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought, sitting down, and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains.\n","Processing asent: For the lawn was very rough.\n","Processing asent: Here sitting on the world, she thought, for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time, perhaps for the last time, as a traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again.\n","Processing asent: The lawn was the world; they were up here together, on this exalted station, she thought, looking at old Mr. Carmichael, who seemed (though they had not said a word all this time) to share her thoughts.\n","Processing asent: And she would never see him again perhaps.\n","Processing asent: He was growing old.\n","Processing asent: Also, she remembered, smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot, he was growing famous.\n","Processing asent: People said that his poetry was \"so beautiful.\"\n","Processing asent: They went and published things he had written forty years ago.\n","Processing asent: There was a famous man now called Carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes one person might wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the same as he had always been.\n","Processing asent: He looked the samegreyer, rather.\n","Processing asent: Yes, he looked the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when he had heard of Andrew Ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a shell; he should have been a great mathematician) Mr. Carmichael had \"lost all interest in life.\"\n","Processing asent: What did it meanthat?\n","Processing asent: she wondered.\n","Processing asent: Had he marched through Trafalgar Square grasping a big stick?\n","Processing asent: Had he turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his room in St. John's Wood alone?\n","Processing asent: She did not know what he had done, when he heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all the same.\n","Processing asent: They only mumbled at each other on staircases; they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it won't be fine.\n","Processing asent: But this was one way of knowing people, she thought: to know the outline, not the detail, to sit in one's garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather.\n","Processing asent: She knew him in that way.\n","Processing asent: She knew that he had changed somehow.\n","Processing asent: She had never read a line of his poetry.\n","Processing asent: She thought that she knew how it went though, slowly and sonorously.\n","Processing asent: It was seasoned and mellow.\n","Processing asent: It was about the desert and the camel.\n","Processing asent: It was about the palm tree and the sunset.\n","Processing asent: It was extremely impersonal; it said something about death; it said very little about love.\n","Processing asent: There was an impersonality about him.\n","Processing asent: He wanted very little of other people.\n","Processing asent: Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window with some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid Mrs. Ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like?\n","Processing asent: On that account, of course, she would always try to make him stop.\n","Processing asent: He would bow to her.\n","Processing asent: He would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly.\n","Processing asent: Annoyed that he did not want anything of her, Mrs. Ramsay would ask him (Lily could hear her) wouldn't he like a coat, a rug, a newspaper?\n","Processing asent: No, he wanted nothing.\n","Processing asent: (Here he bowed.)\n","Processing asent: There was some quality in her which he did not much like.\n","Processing asent: It was perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness, something matter-of-fact in her.\n","Processing asent: She was so direct.\n","Processing asent: (A noise drew her attention to the drawing-room windowthe squeak of a hinge. The light breeze was toying with the window.)\n","Processing asent: There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily thought (Yes; she realised that the drawing-room step was empty, but it had no effect on her whatever. She did not want Mrs. Ramsay now.)People who thought her too sure, too drastic.\n","Processing asent: Also, her beauty offended people probably.\n","Processing asent: How monotonous, they would say, and the same always!\n","Processing asent: They preferred another typethe dark, the vivacious.\n","Processing asent: Then she was weak with her husband.\n","Processing asent: She let him make those scenes.\n","Processing asent: Then she was reserved.\n","Processing asent: Nobody knew exactly what had happened to her.\n","Processing asent: And (to go back to Mr. Carmichael and his dislike) one could not imagine Mrs. Ramsay standing painting, lying reading, a whole morning on the lawn.\n","Processing asent: It was unthinkable.\n","Processing asent: Without saying a word, the only token of her errand a basket on her arm, she went off to the town, to the poor, to sit in some stuffy little bedroom.\n","Processing asent: Often and often Lily had seen her go silently in the midst of some game, some discussion, with her basket on her arm, very upright.\n","Processing asent: She had noted her return.\n","Processing asent: She had thought, half laughing (she was so methodical with the tea cups), half moved (her beauty took one's breath away), eyes that are closing in pain have looked on you.\n","Processing asent: You have been with them there.\n","Processing asent: And then Mrs. Ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late, or the butter not fresh, or the teapot chipped.\n","Processing asent: And all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of Greek temples, and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room.\n","Processing asent: She never talked of itshe went, punctually, directly.\n","Processing asent: It was her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for the south, the artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly to the human race, making her nest in its heart.\n","Processing asent: And this, like all instincts, was a little distressing to people who did not share it; to Mr. Carmichael perhaps, to herself certainly.\n","Processing asent: Some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought.\n","Processing asent: Her going was a reproach to them, gave a different twist to the world, so that they were led to protest, seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and clutch at them vanishing.\n","Processing asent: Charles Tansley did that too: it was part of the reason why one disliked him.\n","Processing asent: He upset the proportions of one's world.\n","Processing asent: And what had happened to him, she wondered, idly stirring the platains with her brush.\n","Processing asent: He had got his fellowship.\n","Processing asent: He had married; he lived at Golder's Green.\n","Processing asent: She had gone one day into a Hall and heard him speaking during the war.\n","Processing asent: He was denouncing something: he was condemning somebody.\n","Processing asent: He was preaching brotherly love.\n","Processing asent: And all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another, who had stood behind her smoking shag (\"fivepence an ounce, Miss Briscoe\") and making it his business to tell her women can't write, women can't paint, not so much that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it?\n","Processing asent: There he was lean and red and raucous, preaching love from a platform (there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brushred, energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley).\n","Processing asent: She had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall, pumping love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and Mrs. Ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, dear! What a nuisance! Lost again. Don't bother, Mr. Tansley. I lose thousands every summer,\" at which he pressed his chin back against his collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly.\n","Processing asent: He must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone.\n","Processing asent: He was educating his little sister, Mrs. Ramsay had told her.\n","Processing asent: It was immensely to his credit.\n","Processing asent: Her own idea of him was grotesque, Lily knew well, stirring the plantains with her brush.\n","Processing asent: Half one's notions of other people were, after all, grotesque.\n","Processing asent: They served private purposes of one's own.\n","Processing asent: He did for her instead of a whipping-boy.\n","Processing asent: She found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper.\n","Processing asent: If she wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to Mrs. Ramsay's sayings, to look at him through her eyes.\n","Processing asent: She raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over.\n","Processing asent: She reduced them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in their cosmogony.\n","Processing asent: Some ran this way, others that.\n","Processing asent: One wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with, she reflected.\n","Processing asent: Fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with, she thought.\n","Processing asent: Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her beauty.\n","Processing asent: One wanted most some secret sense, fine as air, with which to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting, talking, sitting silent in the window alone; which took to itself and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer, her thoughts, her imaginations, her desires.\n","Processing asent: What did the hedge mean to her, what did the garden mean to her, what did it mean to her when a wave broke?\n","Processing asent: (Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs. Ramsay look up; she too heard a wave falling on the beach.)\n","Processing asent: And then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried, \"How's that? How's that?\" cricketing?\n","Processing asent: She would stop knitting for a second.\n","Processing asent: She would look intent.\n","Processing asent: Then she would lapse again, and suddenly Mr. Ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over her and looked down at her.\n","Processing asent: Lily could see him.\n","Processing asent: He stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair.\n","Processing asent: It seemed somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen.\n","Processing asent: An old-fashioned scene that was, which required, very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers.\n","Processing asent: Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs. Ramsay had thought (Lily supposed) the time has come now.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she would say it now.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she would marry him.\n","Processing asent: And she stepped slowly, quietly on shore.\n","Processing asent: Probably she said one word only, letting her hand rest still in his.\n","Processing asent: I will marry you, she might have said, with her hand in his; but no more.\n","Processing asent: Time after time the same thrill had passed between themobviously it had, Lily thought, smoothing a way for her ants.\n","Processing asent: She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen.\n","Processing asent: For in the rough and tumble of daily life, with all those children about, all those visitors, one had constantly a sense of repetitionof one thing falling where another had fallen, and so setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations.\n","Processing asent: But it would be a mistake, she thought, thinking how they walked off together, arm in arm, past the greenhouse, to simplify their relationship.\n","Processing asent: It was no monotony of blissshe with her impulses and quicknesses; he with his shudders and glooms.\n","Processing asent: Oh, no.\n","Processing asent: The bedroom door would slam violently early in the morning.\n","Processing asent: He would start from the table in a temper.\n","Processing asent: He would whizz his plate through the window.\n","Processing asent: Then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship- shape.\n","Processing asent: She had met Paul Rayley like that one day on the stairs.\n","Processing asent: They had laughed and laughed, like a couple of children, all because Mr. Ramsay, finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside.\n","Processing asent: 'An earwig, Prue murmured, awestruck, 'in his milk.'\n","Processing asent: Other people might find centipedes.\n","Processing asent: But he had built round him such a fence of sanctity, and occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig in his milk was a monster.\n","Processing asent: But it tired Mrs. Ramsay, it cowed her a littlethe plates whizzing and the doors slamming.\n","Processing asent: And there would fall between them sometimes long rigid silences, when, in a state of mind which annoyed Lily in her, half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly, or to laugh as they laughed, but in her weariness perhaps concealed something.\n","Processing asent: She brooded and sat silent.\n","Processing asent: After a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she wasroaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking, for she would take care to be busy when he passed, and evade him, and pretend not to see him.\n","Processing asent: Then he would turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane, and try to win her so.\n","Processing asent: Still she would hold off, and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at her side.\n","Processing asent: At length, standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound (Lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps, at the window, where she had seen him), he would say her name, once only, for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow, but still she held back; and he would say it once more, and this time something in the tone would rouse her, and she would go to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk off together among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the raspberry beds.\n","Processing asent: They would have it out together.\n","Processing asent: But with what attitudes and with what words?\n","Processing asent: Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that, turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort, and begin picking flowers, throwing balls, chattering, until it was time for dinner, and there they were, he at one end of the table, she at the other, as usual.\n","Processing asent: \"Why don't some of you take up botany?.. With all those legs and arms why doesn't one of you...?\"\n","Processing asent: So they would talk as usual, laughing, among the children.\n","Processing asent: All would be as usual, save only for some quiver, as of a blade in the air, which came and went between them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and the cabbages.\n","Processing asent: Especially, Lily thought, Mrs. Ramsay would glance at Prue.\n","Processing asent: She sat in the middle between brothers and sisters, always occupied, it seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong so that she scarcely spoke herself.\n","Processing asent: How Prue must have blamed herself for that earwig in the milk How white she had gone when Mr. Ramsay threw his plate through the window!\n","Processing asent: How she drooped under those long silences between them!\n","Processing asent: Anyhow, her mother now would seem to be making it up to her; assuring her that everything was well; promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be hers.\n","Processing asent: She had enjoyed it for less than a year, however.\n","Processing asent: She had let the flowers fall from her basket, Lily thought, screwing up her eyes and standing back as if to look at her picture, which she was not touching, however, with all her faculties in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed.\n","Processing asent: She let her flowers fall from her basket, scattered and tumbled them on to the grass and, reluctantly and hesitatingly, but without question or complainthad she not the faculty of obedience to perfection?went too.\n","Processing asent: Down fields, across valleys, white, flower-strewnthat was how she would have painted it.\n","Processing asent: The hills were austere.\n","Processing asent: It was rocky; it was steep.\n","Processing asent: The waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath.\n","Processing asent: They went, the three of them together, Mrs. Ramsay walking rather fast in front, as if she expected to meet some one round the corner.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light stuff behind it.\n","Processing asent: At last then somebody had come into the drawing-room; somebody was sitting in the chair.\n","Processing asent: For Heaven's sake, she prayed, let them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her.\n","Processing asent: Mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside; had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd-shaped triangular shadow over the step.\n","Processing asent: It altered the composition of the picture a little.\n","Processing asent: It was interesting.\n","Processing asent: It might be useful.\n","Processing asent: Her mood was coming back to her.\n","Processing asent: One must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion, the determination not to be put off, not to be bamboozled.\n","Processing asent: One must hold the scenesoin a vise and let nothing come in and spoil it.\n","Processing asent: One wanted, she thought, dipping her brush deliberately, to be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that's a chair, that's a table, and yet at the same time, It's a miracle, it's an ecstasy.\n","Processing asent: The problem might be solved after all.\n","Processing asent: Ah, but what had happened?\n","Processing asent: Some wave of white went over the window pane.\n","Processing asent: The air must have stirred some flounce in the room.\n","Processing asent: Her heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her.\n","Processing asent: \"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\" she cried, feeling the old horror come backto want and want and not to have.\n","Processing asent: Could she inflict that still?\n","Processing asent: And then, quietly, as if she refrained, that too became part of ordinary experience, was on a level with the chair, with the table.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Ramsayit was part of her perfect goodnesssat there quite simply, in the chair, flicked her needles to and fro, knitted her reddish-brown stocking, cast her shadow on the step.\n","Processing asent: There she sat.\n","Processing asent: And as if she had something she must share, yet could hardly leave her easel, so full her mind was of what she was thinking, of what she was seeing, Lily went past Mr. Carmichael holding her brush to the edge of the lawn.\n","Processing asent: Where was that boat now?\n","Processing asent: And Mr. Ramsay?\n","Processing asent: She wanted him.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 13\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay had almost done reading.\n","Processing asent: One hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it.\n","Processing asent: He sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about, extraordinarily exposed to everything.\n","Processing asent: He looked very old.\n","Processing asent: He looked, James thought, getting his head now against the Lighthouse, now against the waste of waters running away into the open, like some old stone lying on the sand; he looked as if he had become physically what was always at the back of both of their mindsthat loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things.\n","Processing asent: He was reading very quickly, as if he were eager to get to the end.\n","Processing asent: Indeed they were very close to the Lighthouse now.\n","Processing asent: There it loomed up, stark and straight, glaring white and black, and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks.\n","Processing asent: One could see lines and creases in the rocks.\n","Processing asent: One could see the windows clearly; a dab of white on one of them, and a little tuft of green on the rock.\n","Processing asent: A man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again.\n","Processing asent: So it was like that, James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock.\n","Processing asent: It satisfied him.\n","Processing asent: It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character.\n","Processing asent: The old ladies, he thought, thinking of the garden at home, went dragging their chairs about on the lawn.\n","Processing asent: Old Mrs. Beckwith, for example, was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy, but as a matter of fact, James thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood there on its rock, it's like that.\n","Processing asent: He looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight.\n","Processing asent: They shared that knowledge.\n","Processing asent: \"We are driving before a galewe must sink,\" he began saying to himself, half aloud, exactly as his father said it.\n","Processing asent: Nobody seemed to have spoken for an age.\n","Processing asent: Cam was tired of looking at the sea.\n","Processing asent: Little bits of black cork had floated past; the fish were dead in the bottom of the boat.\n","Processing asent: Still her father read, and James looked at him and she looked at him, and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death, and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought.\n","Processing asent: It was thus that he escaped, she thought.\n","Processing asent: Yes, with his great forehead and his great nose, holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him, he escaped.\n","Processing asent: You might try to lay hands on him, but then like a bird, he spread his wings, he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump.\n","Processing asent: She gazed at the immense expanse of the sea.\n","Processing asent: The island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer.\n","Processing asent: It looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover.\n","Processing asent: Yet in its frailty were all those paths, those terraces, those bedrooms all those innumberable things.\n","Processing asent: But as, just before sleep, things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing, and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind.\n","Processing asent: It was a hanging garden; it was a valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes...She was falling asleep.\n","Processing asent: \"Come now,\" said Mr. Ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.\n","Processing asent: Come where?\n","Processing asent: To what extraordinary adventure?\n","Processing asent: She woke with a start.\n","Processing asent: To land somewhere, to climb somewhere?\n","Processing asent: Where was he leading them?\n","Processing asent: For after his immense silence the words startled them.\n","Processing asent: But it was absurd.\n","Processing asent: He was hungry, he said.\n","Processing asent: It was time for lunch.\n","Processing asent: Besides, look, he said.\n","Processing asent: \"There's the Lighthouse. We're almost there.\"\n","Processing asent: \"He's doing very well,\" said Macalister, praising James.\n","Processing asent: \"He's keeping her very steady.\"\n","Processing asent: But his father never praised him, James thought grimly.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them.\n","Processing asent: Now he was happy, eating bread and cheese with these fishermen.\n","Processing asent: He would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour spitting with the other old men, James thought, watching him slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.\n","Processing asent: This is right, this is it, Cam kept feeling, as she peeled her hard- boiled egg.\n","Processing asent: Now she felt as she did in the study when the old men were reading THE TIMES.\n","Processing asent: Now I can go on thinking whatever I like, and I shan't fall over a precipice or be drowned, for there he is, keeping his eye on me, she thought.\n","Processing asent: At the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it was very excitingit seemed as if they were doing two things at once; they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck.\n","Processing asent: Would the water last?\n","Processing asent: Would the provisions last?\n","Processing asent: she asked herself, telling herself a story but knowing at the same time what was the truth.\n","Processing asent: They would soon be out of it, Mr. Ramsay was saying to old Macalister; but their children would see some strange things.\n","Processing asent: Macalister said he was seventy-five last March; Mr. Ramsay was seventy-one.\n","Processing asent: Macalister said he had never seen a doctor; he had never lost a tooth.\n","Processing asent: And that's the way I'd like my children to liveCam was sure that her father was thinking that, for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her, as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived, that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel.\n","Processing asent: She should not waste it.\n","Processing asent: He said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once, and then he gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were a great Spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at a window (so courteous his manner was).\n","Processing asent: He was shabby, and simple, eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.\n","Processing asent: \"That was where she sunk,\" said Macalister's boy suddenly.\n","Processing asent: Three men were drowned where we are now, the old man said.\n","Processing asent: He had seen them clinging to the mast himself.\n","Processing asent: And Mr. Ramsay taking a look at the spot was about, James and Cam were afraid, to burst out:\n","Processing asent: But I beneath a rougher sea,\n","Processing asent: and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud; they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him; but to their surprise all he said was \"Ah\" as if he thought to himself.\n","Processing asent: But why make a fuss about that?\n","Processing asent: Naturally men are drowned in a storm, but it is a perfectly straightforward affair, and the depths of the sea (he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them) are only water after all.\n","Processing asent: Then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch.\n","Processing asent: He looked at it attentively; he made, perhaps, some mathematical calculation.\n","Processing asent: At last he said, triumphantly:\n","Processing asent: \"Well done!\"\n","Processing asent: James had steered them like a born sailor.\n","Processing asent: There!\n","Processing asent: Cam thought, addressing herself silently to James.\n","Processing asent: You've got it at last.\n","Processing asent: For she knew that this was what James had been wanting, and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not look at her or at his father or at any one.\n","Processing asent: There he sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright, looking rather sulky and frowning slightly.\n","Processing asent: He was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure.\n","Processing asent: His father had praised him.\n","Processing asent: They must think that he was perfectly indifferent.\n","Processing asent: But you've got it now, Cam thought.\n","Processing asent: They had tacked, and they were sailing swiftly, buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef.\n","Processing asent: On the left a row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and became greener and on one, a higher rock, a wave incessantly broke and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower.\n","Processing asent: One could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever.\n","Processing asent: Now they could see two men on the Lighthouse, watching them and making ready to meet them.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Ramsay buttoned his coat, and turned up his trousers.\n","Processing asent: He took the large, badly packed, brown paper parcel which Nancy had got ready and sat with it on his knee.\n","Processing asent: Thus in complete readiness to land he sat looking back at the island.\n","Processing asent: With his long-sighted eyes perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf-like shape standing on end on a plate of gold quite clearly.\n","Processing asent: What could he see?\n","Processing asent: Cam wondered.\n","Processing asent: It was all a blur to her.\n","Processing asent: What was he thinking now?\n","Processing asent: she wondered.\n","Processing asent: What was it he sought, so fixedly, so intently, so silently?\n","Processing asent: They watched him, both of them, sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away.\n","Processing asent: What do you want?\n","Processing asent: they both wanted to ask.\n","Processing asent: They both wanted to say, Ask us anything and we will give it you.\n","Processing asent: But he did not ask them anything.\n","Processing asent: He sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking, We perished, each alone, or he might be thinking, I have reached it.\n","Processing asent: I have found it; but he said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Then he put on his hat.\n","Processing asent: \"Bring those parcels,\" he said, nodding his head at the things Nancy had done up for them to take to the Lighthouse.\n","Processing asent: \"The parcels for the Lighthouse men,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: He rose and stood in the bow of the boat, very straight and tall, for all the world, James thought, as if he were saying, \"There is no God,\" and Cam thought, as if he were leaping into space, and they both rose to follow him as he sprang, lightly like a young man, holding his parcel, on to the rock.\n","Processing asent: SECTION 14\n","Processing asent: \"He must have reached it,\" said Lily Briscoe aloud, feeling suddenly completely tired out.\n","Processing asent: For the Lighthouse had become almost invisible, had melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there, which both seemed to be one and the same effort, had stretched her body and mind to the utmost.\n","Processing asent: Ah, but she was relieved.\n","Processing asent: Whatever she had wanted to give him, when he left her that morning, she had given him at last.\n","Processing asent: \"He has landed,\" she said aloud.\n","Processing asent: \"It is finished.\"\n","Processing asent: Then, surging up, puffing slightly, old Mr. Carmichael stood beside her, looking like an old pagan god, shaggy, with weeds in his hair and the trident (it was only a French novel) in his hand.\n","Processing asent: He stood by her on the edge of the lawn, swaying a little in his bulk and said, shading his eyes with his hand: \"They will have landed,\" and she felt that she had been right.\n","Processing asent: They had not needed to speak.\n","Processing asent: They had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything.\n","Processing asent: He stood there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind; she thought he was surveying, tolerantly and compassionately, their final destiny.\n","Processing asent: Now he has crowned the occasion, she thought, when his hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which, fluttering slowly, lay at length upon the earth.\n","Processing asent: Quickly, as if she were recalled by something over there, she turned to her canvas.\n","Processing asent: There it washer picture.\n","Processing asent: Yes, with all its greens and blues, its lines running up and across, its attempt at something.\n","Processing asent: It would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be destroyed.\n","Processing asent: But what did that matter?\n","Processing asent: she asked herself, taking up her brush again.\n","Processing asent: She looked at the steps; they were empty; she looked at her canvas; it was blurred.\n","Processing asent: With a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the centre.\n","Processing asent: It was done; it was finished.\n","Processing asent: Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision.\n","About to return sents_ls with len = 3572\n","Processing Novel #31: wgolding_lordoftheflies\n","  Size: 338577\n","BEFORE stripping out headings len: 333136\n","   Parag count before processing sents: 1\n","pysbd found 1806 Sentences in Paragraph #0\n","      1806 Sentences remain after cleaning\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER ONE  The Sound of the Shell The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead.\n","Processing asent: All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat.\n","Processing asent: He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.\n","Processing asent: \"Hi!\" it said.\n","Processing asent: \"Wait a minute!\"\n","Processing asent: The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.\n","Processing asent: \"Wait a minute,\" the voice said.\n","Processing asent: \"I got caught up.\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.\n","Processing asent: The voice spoke again.\n","Processing asent: \"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things.\"\n","Processing asent: The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker.\n","Processing asent: The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns.\n","Processing asent: He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around.\n","Processing asent: He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat.\n","Processing asent: He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.\n","Processing asent: \"Where's the man with the megaphone?\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy shook his head.\n","Processing asent: \"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere.\"\n","Processing asent: The fat boy looked startled.\n","Processing asent: \"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.\n","Processing asent: \"All them other kids,\" the fat boy went on.\n","Processing asent: \"Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water.\n","Processing asent: He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.\n","Processing asent: \"Aren't there any grownups at all?\" \"I don't think so.\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him.\n","Processing asent: In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.\n","Processing asent: \"No grownups!\"\n","Processing asent: The fat boy thought for a moment.\n","Processing asent: \"That pilot.\"\n","Processing asent: The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.\n","Processing asent: \"He must have flown off after he dropped us.

You haven't seen any others, have you?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shook his head and increased his speed.\n","Processing asent: Then he tripped over a branch and came down with a crash.\n","Processing asent: The fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.\n","Processing asent: \"My auntie told me not to run,\" he explained, \"on account of my asthma.\" \"Ass-mar?\" \"That's right. Can't catch my breath. I was the only boy in our school what had asthma,\" said the fat boy with a touch of pride.\n","Processing asent: \"And I've been wearing specs since I was three.\"\n","Processing asent: He took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker.\n","Processing asent: An expression of pain and inward concentration altered the pale contours of his face.\n","Processing asent: He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose.\n","Processing asent: \"Them fruit.\"\n","Processing asent: He glanced round the scar.\n","Processing asent: \"Them fruit,\" he said, \"I expect--\"\n","Processing asent: He put on his glasses, waded away from Ralph, and crouched down among the tangled foliage. \"I'll be out again in just a minute--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches.\n","Processing asent: In a few seconds the fat boy's grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still lay between him and the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle.\n","Processing asent: The shore was fledged with palm trees.\n","Processing asent: These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air.\n","Processing asent: The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings.\n","Processing asent: Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood, one hand against a grey trunk, and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering water.\n","Processing asent: Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was dark blue.\n","Processing asent: Within the irregular arc of coral the lagoon was still as a mountain lake--blue of all shades and shadowy green and purple.\n","Processing asent: The beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick, endless apparently, for to Ralph's left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity; and always, almost visible, was the heat.\n","Processing asent: He jumped down from the terrace.\n","Processing asent: The sand was thick over his black shoes and the heat hit him.\n","Processing asent: He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement.\n","Processing asent: Then he leapt back on the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin.\n","Processing asent: He undid the snake-clasp of his belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and the water.\n","Processing asent: He was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward.\n","Processing asent: You could see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.\n","Processing asent: He patted the palm trunk softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head.\n","Processing asent: He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest.\n","Processing asent: Then he sat back and looked at the water with bright, excited eyes.\n","Processing asent: \"Ralph--\"\n","Processing asent: The fat boy lowered himself over the terrace and sat down carefully, using the edge as a seat. \"I'm sorry I been such a time. Them fruit--\"\n","Processing asent: He wiped his glasses and adjusted them on his button nose.\n","Processing asent: The frame had made a deep, pink \"V\" on the bridge.\n","Processing asent: He looked critically at Ralph's golden body and then down at his own clothes.\n","Processing asent: He laid a hand on the end of a zipper that extended down his chest.\n","Processing asent: \"My auntie--\"\n","Processing asent: Then he opened the zipper with decision and pulled the whole wind-breaker over his head.\n","Processing asent: \"There!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him sidelong and said nothing.\n","Processing asent: \"I expect we'll want to know all their names,\" said the fat boy, \"and make a list. We ought to have a meeting.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue.\n","Processing asent: \"I don't care what they call me,\" he said confidentially, \"so long as they don't call me what they used to call me at school.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph was faintly interested.\n","Processing asent: \"What was that?\"\n","Processing asent: The fat boy glanced over his shoulder, then leaned toward Ralph.\n","Processing asent: He whispered.\n","Processing asent: \"They used to call me 'Piggy.'\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shrieked with laughter.\n","Processing asent: He jumped up.\n","Processing asent: \"Piggy!

Piggy!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.\n","Processing asent: \"Sche-aa-ow!\"\n","Processing asent: He dived in the sand at Piggy's feet and lay there laughing.\n","Processing asent: \"Piggy!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy grinned reluctantly, pleased despite himself at even this much recognition.\n","Processing asent: \"So long as you don't tell the others--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph giggled into the sand.\n","Processing asent: The expression of pain and concentration returned to Piggy's face.\n","Processing asent: \"Half a sec'.\"\n","Processing asent: He hastened back into the forest.\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood up and trotted along to the right.\n","Processing asent: Here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high.\n","Processing asent: The top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees.\n","Processing asent: There was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on.\n","Processing asent: The palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: Ralph hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided that the shadows on his body were really green.\n","Processing asent: He picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water.\n","Processing asent: It was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral.\n","Processing asent: A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and thither.\n","Processing asent: Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.\n","Processing asent: \"Whizzoh!\"\n","Processing asent: Beyond the platform there was more enchantment.\n","Processing asent: Some act of God--a typhoon perhaps, or the storm that had accompanied his own arrival--had banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end.\n","Processing asent: Ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed.\n","Processing asent: But the island ran true to form and the incredible pool, which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide, was so deep at one end as to be dark green.\n","Processing asent: Ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in.\n","Processing asent: The water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.\n","Processing asent: Piggy appeared again, sat on the rocky ledge, and watched Ralph's green and white body enviously.\n","Processing asent: \"You can't half swim.\" \"Piggy.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy took off his shoes and socks, ranged them carefully on the ledge, and tested the water with one toe.\n","Processing asent: \"It's hot!\" \"What did you expect?\" \"I didn't expect nothing. My auntie--\" \"Sucks to your auntie!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open; the sandy edge of the pool loomed up like a hillside. He turned over, holding his nose, and a golden light danced and shattered just over his face. Piggy was looking determined and began to take off his shorts. Presently he was palely and fatly naked. He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph. \"Aren't you going to swim?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy shook his head. \"I can't swim. I wasn't allowed. My asthma--\" \"Sucks to your ass-mar!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy bore this with a sort of humble patience.\n","Processing asent: \"You can't half swim well.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph paddled backwards down the slope, immersed his mouth and blew a jet of water into the air.\n","Processing asent: Then he lifted his chin and spoke.\n","Processing asent: \"I could swim when I was five. Daddy taught me. He's a commander in the Navy. When he gets leave he'll come and rescue us. What's your father?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy flushed suddenly.\n","Processing asent: \"My dad's dead,\" he said quickly, \"and my mum--\"\n","Processing asent: He took off his glasses and looked vainly for something with which to clean them. \"I used to live with my auntie. She kept a candy store. I used to get ever so many candies. As many as I liked. When'll your dad rescue us?\" \"Soon as he can.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy rose dripping from the water and stood naked, cleaning his glasses with a sock. The only sound that reached them now through the heat of the morning was the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the reef. \"How does he know we're here?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph lolled in the water. Sleep enveloped him like the swathing mirages that were wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon. \"How does he know we're here?\"\n","Processing asent: Because, thought Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef became very distant. \"They'd tell him at the airport.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy shook his head, put on his flashing glasses and looked down at Ralph. \"Not them. Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pulled himself out of the water, stood facing Piggy, and considered this unusual problem. Piggy persisted. \"This an island, isn't it?\" \"I climbed a rock,\" said Ralph slowly, \"and I think this is an island.\" \"They're all dead,\" said Piggy, \"an' this is an island. Nobody don't know we're here. Your dad don't know, nobody don't know--\"\n","Processing asent: His lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist.\n","Processing asent: \"We may stay here till we die.\"\n","Processing asent: With that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence.\n","Processing asent: \"Get my clothes,\" muttered Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \"Along there.\"\n","Processing asent: He trotted through the sand, enduring the sun's enmity, crossed the platform and found his scattered clothes.\n","Processing asent: To put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing.\n","Processing asent: Then he climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk.\n","Processing asent: Piggy hauled himself up, carrying most of his clothes under his arms.\n","Processing asent: Then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled reflections quivered over him.\n","Processing asent: Presently he spoke.\n","Processing asent: \"We got to find the others. We got to do something.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Here was a coral island.\n","Processing asent: Protected from the sun, ignoring Piggy's ill-omened talk, he dreamed pleasantly.\n","Processing asent: Piggy insisted.\n","Processing asent: \"How many of us are there?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph came forward and stood by Piggy.\n","Processing asent: \"I don't know.\"\n","Processing asent: Here and there, little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the haze of heat.\n","Processing asent: When these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds would whisper, so that spots of blurred sunlight slid over their bodies or moved like bright, winged things in the shade.\n","Processing asent: Piggy looked up at Ralph.\n","Processing asent: All the shadows on Ralph's face were reversed; green above, bright below from the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: A blur of sunlight was crawling across his hair.\n","Processing asent: \"We got to do something.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked through him.\n","Processing asent: Here at last was the imagined but never fully realized place leaping into real life.\n","Processing asent: Ralph's lips parted in a delighted smile and Piggy, taking this smile to himself as a mark of recognition, laughed with pleasure.\n","Processing asent: \"If it really is an island--\" \"What's that?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: Something creamy lay among the ferny weeds.\n","Processing asent: \"A stone.\" \"No. A shell.\"\n","Processing asent: Suddenly Piggy was a-bubble with decorous excitement.\n","Processing asent: \"S'right. It's a shell! I seen one like that before. On someone's back wall. A conch he called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It's ever so valuable--\"\n","Processing asent: Near to Ralph's elbow a palm sapling leaned out over the lagoon. Indeed, the weight was already pulling a lump from the poor soil and soon it would fall. He tore out the stem and began to poke about in the water, while the brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that. Piggy leaned dangerously. \"Careful! You'll break it--\" \"Shut up.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph spoke absently.\n","Processing asent: The shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy plaything; but the vivid phantoms of his day-dream still interposed between him and Piggy, who in this context was an irrelevance.\n","Processing asent: The palm sapling, bending, pushed the shell across the weeds.\n","Processing asent: Ralph used one hand as a fulcrum and pressed down with the other till the shell rose, dripping, and Piggy could make a grab.\n","Processing asent: Now the shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched, Ralph too became excited.\n","Processing asent: Piggy babbled: \"--a conch; ever so expensive. I bet if you wanted to buy one, you'd have to pay pounds and pounds and pounds--he had it on his garden wall, and my auntie--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph took the shell from Piggy and a little water ran down his arm. In color the shell was deep cream, touched here and there with fading pink. Between the point, worn away into a little hole, and the pink lips of the mouth, lay eighteen inches of shell with a slight spiral twist and covered with a delicate, embossed pattern. Ralph shook sand out of the deep tube. \"--mooed like a cow,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: \"He had some white stones too, an' a bird cage with a green parrot. He didn't blow the white stones, of course, an' he said--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in Ralph's hands. \"Ralph!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked up. \"We can use this to call the others. Have a meeting. They'll come when they hear us--\"\n","Processing asent: He beamed at Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \"That was what you meant, didn't you? That's why you got the conch out of the water?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pushed back his fair hair.\n","Processing asent: \"How did your friend blow the conch?\" \"He kind of spat,\" said Piggy.\n","Processing asent: \"My auntie wouldn't let me blow on account of my asthma. He said you blew from down here.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy laid a hand on his jutting abdomen.\n","Processing asent: \"You try, Ralph. You'll call the others.\"\n","Processing asent: Doubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew.\n","Processing asent: There came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more.\n","Processing asent: Ralph wiped the salt water off his lips and tried again, but the shell remained silent.\n","Processing asent: \"He kind of spat.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise.\n","Processing asent: This amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting for some minutes, between bouts of laughter.\n","Processing asent: \"He blew from down here.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm.\n","Processing asent: Immediately the thing sounded.\n","Processing asent: A deep, harsh note boomed under the palms, spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain.\n","Processing asent: Clouds of birds rose from the treetops, and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth.\n","Processing asent: Ralph took the shell away from his lips.\n","Processing asent: \"Gosh!\"\n","Processing asent: His ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch.\n","Processing asent: He laid the conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once more.\n","Processing asent: The note boomed again: and then at his firmer pressure, the note, fluking up an octave, became a strident blare more penetrating than before.\n","Processing asent: Piggy was shouting something, his face pleased, his glasses flashing.\n","Processing asent: The birds cried, small animals scuttered.\n","Processing asent: Ralph's breath failed; the note dropped the octave, became a low wubber, was a rush of air.\n","Processing asent: The conch was silent, a gleaming tusk; Ralph's face was dark with breathlessness and the air over the island was full of bird-clamor and echoes ringing.\n","Processing asent: \"I bet you can hear that for miles.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts.\n","Processing asent: Piggy exclaimed: \"There's one!\"\n","Processing asent: A child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the beach.\n","Processing asent: He was a boy of perhaps six years, sturdy and fair, his clothes torn, his face covered with a sticky mess of fruit.\n","Processing asent: His trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back half-way.\n","Processing asent: He jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles; he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform.\n","Processing asent: Piggy helped him up.\n","Processing asent: Meanwhile Ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest.\n","Processing asent: The small boy squatted in front of Ralph, looking up brightly and vertically.\n","Processing asent: As he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his mouth.\n","Processing asent: Piggy leaned down to him.\n","Processing asent: \"What's yer name?\" \"Johnny.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to Ralph, who was not interested because he was still blowing.\n","Processing asent: His face was dark with the violent pleasure of making this stupendous noise, and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake.\n","Processing asent: The shouting in the forest was nearer.\n","Processing asent: Signs of life were visible now on the beach.\n","Processing asent: The sand, trembling beneath the heat haze, concealed many figures in its miles of length; boys were making their way toward the platform through the hot, dumb sand.\n","Processing asent: Three small children, no older than Johnny, appeared from startlingly close at hand, where they had been gorging fruit in the forest.\n","Processing asent: A dark little boy, not much younger than Piggy, parted a tangle of undergrowth, walked on to the platform, and smiled cheerfully at everybody.\n","Processing asent: More and more of them came.\n","Processing asent: Taking their cue from the innocent Johnny, they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited.\n","Processing asent: Ralph continued to blow short, penetrating blasts.\n","Processing asent: Piggy moved among the crowd, asking names and frowning to remember them.\n","Processing asent: The children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the men with megaphones.\n","Processing asent: Some were naked and carrying their clothes; others half-naked, or more or less dressed, in school uniforms, grey, blue, fawn, jacketed, or jerseyed.\n","Processing asent: There were badges, mottoes even, stripes of color in stockings and pullovers.\n","Processing asent: Their heads clustered above the trunks in the green shade; heads brown, fair, black, chestnut, sandy, mouse-colored; heads muttering, whispering, heads full of eyes that watched Ralph and speculated.\n","Processing asent: Something was being done.\n","Processing asent: The children who came along the beach, singly or in twos, leapt into visibility when they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand.\n","Processing asent: Here, the eye was first attracted to a black, bat-like creature that danced on the sand, and only later perceived the body above it.\n","Processing asent: The bat was the child's shadow, shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying feet.\n","Processing asent: Even while he blew, Ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above a fluttering patch of black.\n","Processing asent: The two boys, bullet-headed and with hair like tow, flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting at Ralph like dogs.\n","Processing asent: They were twins, and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication.\n","Processing asent: They breathed together, they grinned together, they were chunky and vital.\n","Processing asent: They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open.\n","Processing asent: Piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts, repeating their names.\n","Processing asent: \"Sam, Eric, Sam, Eric.\"\n","Processing asent: Then he got muddled; the twins shook their heads and pointed at each other and the crowd laughed.\n","Processing asent: At last Ralph ceased to blow and sat there, the conch trailing from one hand, his head bowed on his knees.\n","Processing asent: As the echoes died away so did the laughter, and there was silence.\n","Processing asent: Within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along.\n","Processing asent: Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way.\n","Processing asent: Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing.\n","Processing asent: The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing.\n","Processing asent: Shorts, shirts, and different garments they carried in their hands; but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it.\n","Processing asent: Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill.\n","Processing asent: The heat of the tropics, the descent, the search for food, and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given them the complexions of newly washed plums.\n","Processing asent: The boy who controlled them was dressed in the same way though his cap badge was golden.\n","Processing asent: When his party was about ten yards from the platform he shouted an order and they halted, gasping, sweating, swaying in the fierce light.\n","Processing asent: The boy himself came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying, and peered into what to him was almost complete darkness.\n","Processing asent: \"Where's the man with the trumpet?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph, sensing his sun-blindness, answered him.\n","Processing asent: \"There's no man with a trumpet. Only me.\"\n","Processing asent: The boy came close and peered down at Ralph, screwing up his face as he did so.\n","Processing asent: What he saw of the fair-haired boy with the creamy shell on his knees did not seem to satisfy him.\n","Processing asent: He turned quickly, his black cloak circling.\n","Processing asent: \"Isn't there a ship, then?\"\n","Processing asent: Inside the floating cloak he was tall, thin, and bony; and his hair was red beneath the black cap.\n","Processing asent: His face was crumpled and freckled, and ugly without silliness.\n","Processing asent: Out of this face stared two light blue eyes, frustrated now, and turning, or ready to turn, to anger.\n","Processing asent: \"Isn't there a man here?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph spoke to his back.\n","Processing asent: \"No. We're having a meeting. Come and join in.\"\n","Processing asent: The group of cloaked boys began to scatter from close line.\n","Processing asent: The tall boy shouted at them.\n","Processing asent: \"Choir! Stand still!\"\n","Processing asent: Wearily obedient, the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun.\n","Processing asent: None the less, some began to protest faintly.\n","Processing asent: \"But, Merridew. Please, Merridew . . . can't we?\"\n","Processing asent: Then one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up.\n","Processing asent: They heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie.\n","Processing asent: Merridew, his eyes staring, made the best of a bad job.\n","Processing asent: \"All right then. Sit down. Let him alone.\" \"But Merridew.\" \"He's always throwing a faint,\" said Merridew.\n","Processing asent: \"He did in Gib.; and Addis; and at matins over the precentor.\"\n","Processing asent: This last piece of shop brought sniggers from the choir, who perched like black birds on the criss-cross trunks and examined Ralph with interest.\n","Processing asent: Piggy asked no names.\n","Processing asent: He was intimidated by this uniformed superiority and the offhand authority in Merridew's voice.\n","Processing asent: He shrank to the other side of Ralph and busied himself with his glasses.\n","Processing asent: Merridew turned to Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \"Aren't there any grownups?\" \"No.\"\n","Processing asent: Merridew sat down on a trunk and looked round the circle.\n","Processing asent: \"Then we'll have to look after ourselves.\"\n","Processing asent: Secure on the other side of Ralph, Piggy spoke timidly.\n","Processing asent: \"That's why Ralph made a meeting. So as we can decide what to do. We've heard names. That's Johnny. Those two--they're twins, Sam 'n Eric. Which is Eric--? You? No-- you're Sam--\" \"I'm Sam--\" \"'n I'm Eric.\" \"We'd better all have names,\" said Ralph, \"so I'm Ralph.\" \"We got most names,\" said Piggy. \"Got 'em just now.\" \"Kids' names,\" said Merridew. \"Why should I be Jack? I'm Merridew.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned to him quickly. This was the voice of one who knew his own mind. \"Then,\" went on Piggy, \"that boy--I forget--\" \"You're talking too much,\" said Jack Merridew. \"Shut up, Fatty.\"\n","Processing asent: Laughter arose. \"He's not Fatty,\" cried Ralph, \"his real name's Piggy!\" \"Piggy!\" \"Piggy!\" \"Oh, Piggy!\"\n","Processing asent: A storm of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in. For the moment the boys were a closed circuit of sympathy with Piggy outside: he went very pink, bowed his head and cleaned his glasses again. Finally the laughter died away and the naming continued. There was Maurice, next in size among the choir boys to Jack, but broad and grinning all the time. There was a slight, furtive boy whom no one knew, who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy. He muttered that his name was Roger and was silent again. Bill, Robert, Harold, Henry; the choir boy who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk, smiled pallidly at Ralph and said that his name was Simon. Jack spoke. \"We've got to decide about being rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a buzz. One of the small boys, Henry, said that he wanted to go home. \"Shut up,\" said Ralph absently. He lifted the conch. \"Seems to me we ought to have a chief to decide things.\" \"A chief! A chief!\" \"I ought to be chief,\" said Jack with simple arrogance, \"because I'm chapter chorister and head boy. I can sing C sharp.\"\n","Processing asent: Another buzz. \"Well then,\" said Jack, \"I--\"\n","Processing asent: He hesitated.\n","Processing asent: The dark boy, Roger, stirred at last and spoke up.\n","Processing asent: \"Let's have a vote.\" \"Yes!\" \"Vote for chief!\" \"Let's vote--\"\n","Processing asent: This toy of voting was almost as pleasing as the conch.\n","Processing asent: Jack started to protest but the clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of Ralph himself.\n","Processing asent: None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack.\n","Processing asent: But there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch.\n","Processing asent: The being that had blown that, had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.\n","Processing asent: \"Him with the shell.\" \"Ralph! Ralph!\" \"Let him be chief with the trumpet-thing.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph raised a hand for silence.\n","Processing asent: \"All right. Who wants Jack for chief?\"\n","Processing asent: With dreary obedience the choir raised their hands.\n","Processing asent: \"Who wants me?\"\n","Processing asent: Every hand outside the choir except Piggy's was raised immediately.\n","Processing asent: Then Piggy, too, raised his hand grudgingly into the air.\n","Processing asent: Ralph counted.\n","Processing asent: \"I'm chief then.\"\n","Processing asent: The circle of boys broke into applause.\n","Processing asent: Even the choir applauded; and the freckles on Jack's face disappeared under a blush of mortification.\n","Processing asent: He started up, then changed his mind and sat down again while the air rang.\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him, eager to offer something.\n","Processing asent: \"The choir belongs to you, of course.\" \"They could be the army--\" \"Or hunters--\" \"They could be--\"\n","Processing asent: The suffusion drained away from Jack's face. Ralph waved again for silence. \"Jack's in charge of the choir. They can be--what do you want them to be?\" \"Hunters.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack and Ralph smiled at each other with shy liking.\n","Processing asent: The rest began to talk eagerly.\n","Processing asent: Jack stood up.\n","Processing asent: \"All right, choir. Take off your togs.\"\n","Processing asent: As if released from class, the choir boys stood up, chattered, piled their black cloaks on the grass.\n","Processing asent: Jack laid his on the trunk by Ralph.\n","Processing asent: His grey shorts were sticking to him with sweat.\n","Processing asent: Ralph glanced at them admiringly, and when Jack saw his glance he explained.\n","Processing asent: \"I tried to get over that hill to see if there was water all round. But your shell called us.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph smiled and held up the conch for silence.\n","Processing asent: \"Listen, everybody. I've got to have time to think things out. I can't decide what to do straight off. If this isn't an island we might be rescued straight away. So we've got to decide if this is an island. Everybody must stay round here and wait and not go away. Three of us--if we take more we'd get all mixed, and lose each other--three of us will go on an expedition and find out. I'll go, and Jack, and, and . . .\"\n","Processing asent: He looked round the circle of eager faces.\n","Processing asent: There was no lack of boys to choose from.\n","Processing asent: \"And Simon.\"\n","Processing asent: The boys round Simon giggled, and he stood up, laughing a little.\n","Processing asent: Now that the pallor of his faint was over, he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and coarse.\n","Processing asent: He nodded at Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \"I'll come.\" \"And I--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack snatched from behind him a sizable sheath-knife and clouted it into a trunk.\n","Processing asent: The buzz rose and died away.\n","Processing asent: Piggy stirred.\n","Processing asent: \"I'll come.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned to him.\n","Processing asent: \"You're no good on a job like this.\" \"All the same--\" \"We don't want you,\" said Jack, flatly. \"Three's enough.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy's glasses flashed. \"I was with him when he found the conch. I was with him before anyone else was.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack and the others paid no attention. There was a general dispersal. Ralph, Jack and Simon jumped off the platform and walked along the sand past the bathing pool. Piggy hung bumbling behind them. \"If Simon walks in the middle of us,\" said Ralph, \"then we could talk over his head.\"\n","Processing asent: The three of them fell into step. This meant that every now and then Simon had to do a double shuffle to catch up with the others. Presently Ralph stopped and turned back to Piggy. \"Look.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack and Simon pretended to notice nothing. They walked on. \"You can't come.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy's glasses were misted again--this time with humiliation.\n","Processing asent: \"You told 'em. After what I said.\"\n","Processing asent: His face flushed, his mouth trembled. \"After I said I didn't want--\" \"What on earth are you talking about?\" \"About being called Piggy. I said I didn't care as long as they didn't call me Piggy; an' I said not to tell and then you went an' said straight out--\"\n","Processing asent: Stillness descended on them.\n","Processing asent: Ralph, looking with more understanding at Piggy, saw that he was hurt and crushed.\n","Processing asent: He hovered between the two courses of apology or further insult.\n","Processing asent: \"Better Piggy than Fatty,\" he said at last, with the directness of genuine leadership, \"and anyway, I'm sorry if you feel like that. Now go back, Piggy, and take names. That's your job. So long.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned and raced after the other two.\n","Processing asent: Piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded slowly from his cheeks.\n","Processing asent: He went back to the platform.\n","Processing asent: The three boys walked briskly on the sand.\n","Processing asent: The tide was low and there was a strip of weed-strewn beach that was almost as firm as a road.\n","Processing asent: A kind of glamour was spread over them and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it.\n","Processing asent: They turned to each other, laughing excitedly, talking, not listening.\n","Processing asent: The air was bright.\n","Processing asent: Ralph, faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over.\n","Processing asent: When they had done laughing, Simon stroked Ralph's arm shyly; and they had to laugh again.\n","Processing asent: \"Come on,\" said Jack presently, \"we're explorers.\" \"We'll go to the end of the island,\" said Ralph, \"and look round the corner.\" \"If it is an island--\"\n","Processing asent: Now, toward the end of the afternoon, the mirages were settling a little. They found the end of the island, quite distinct, and not magicked out of shape or sense. There was a jumble of the usual squareness, with one great block sitting out in the lagoon. Sea birds were nesting there. \"Like icing,\" said Ralph, \"on a pink cake.\" \"We shan't see round this corner,\" said Jack, \"because there isn't one. Only a slow curve--and you can see, the rocks get worse--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shaded his eyes and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the mountain.\n","Processing asent: This part of the beach was nearer the mountain than any other that they had seen.\n","Processing asent: \"We'll try climbing the mountain from here,\" he said.\n","Processing asent: \"I should think this is the easiest way. There's less of that jungly stuff; and more pink rock. Come on.\"\n","Processing asent: The three boys began to scramble up.\n","Processing asent: Some unknown force had wrenched and shattered these cubes so that they lay askew, often piled diminishingly on each other.\n","Processing asent: The most usual feature of the rock was a pink cliff surmounted by a skewed block; and that again surmounted, and that again, till the pinkness became a stack of balanced rock projecting through the looped fantasy of the forest creepers.\n","Processing asent: Where the pink cliffs rose out of the ground there were often narrow tracks winding upwards.\n","Processing asent: They could edge along them, deep in the plant world, their faces to the rock.\n","Processing asent: \"What made this track?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack paused, wiping the sweat from his face.\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood by him, breathless.\n","Processing asent: \"Men?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack shook his head.\n","Processing asent: \"Animals.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph peered into the darkness under the trees.\n","Processing asent: The forest minutely vibrated.\n","Processing asent: \"Come on.\"\n","Processing asent: The difficulty was not the steep ascent round the shoulders of rock, but the occasional plunges through the undergrowth to get to the next path.\n","Processing asent: Here the roots and stems of creepers were in such tangles that the boys had to thread through them like pliant needles.\n","Processing asent: Their only guide, apart from the brown ground and occasional flashes of light through the foliage, was the tendency of slope: whether this hole, laced as it was with the cables of creeper, stood higher than that.\n","Processing asent: Somehow, they moved up.\n","Processing asent: Immured in these tangles, at perhaps their most difficult moment, Ralph turned with shining eyes to the others.\n","Processing asent: \"Wacco.\" \"Wizard.\" \"Smashing.\"\n","Processing asent: The cause of their pleasure was not obvious.\n","Processing asent: All three were hot, dirty and exhausted.\n","Processing asent: Ralph was badly scratched.\n","Processing asent: The creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels for further penetration.\n","Processing asent: Ralph shouted experimentally and they listened to the muted echoes.\n","Processing asent: \"This is real exploring,\" said Jack.\n","Processing asent: \"I bet nobody's been here before.\" \"We ought to draw a map,\" said Ralph, \"only we haven't any paper.\" \"We could make scratches on bark,\" said Simon, \"and rub black stuff in.\"\n","Processing asent: Again came the solemn communion of shining eyes in the gloom.\n","Processing asent: \"Wacco.\" \"Wizard.\"\n","Processing asent: There was no place for standing on one's head.\n","Processing asent: This time Ralph expressed the intensity of his emotion by pretending to knock Simon down; and soon they were a happy, heaving pile in the under-dusk.\n","Processing asent: When they had fallen apart Ralph spoke first.\n","Processing asent: \"Got to get on.\"\n","Processing asent: The pink granite of the next cliff was further back from the creepers and trees so that they could trot up the path.\n","Processing asent: This again led into more open forest so that they had a glimpse of the spread sea.\n","Processing asent: With openness came the sun; it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes in the dark, damp heat.\n","Processing asent: At last the way to the top looked like a scramble over pink rock, with no more plunging through darkness.\n","Processing asent: The boys chose their way through defiles and over heaps of sharp stone.\n","Processing asent: \"Look! Look!\"\n","Processing asent: High over this end of the island, the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks and chimneys.\n","Processing asent: This one, against which Jack leaned, moved with a grating sound when they pushed.\n","Processing asent: \"Come on--\"\n","Processing asent: But not \"Come on\" to the top. The assault on the summit must wait while the three boys accepted this challenge. The rock was as large as a small motor car. \"Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: Sway back and forth, catch the rhythm. \"Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: Increase the swing of the pendulum, increase, increase, come up and bear against that point of furthest balance-- increase--increase-- \"Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: The great rock loitered, poised on one toe, decided not to return, moved through the air, fell, struck, turned over, leapt droning through the air and smashed a deep hole in the canopy of the forest.\n","Processing asent: Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated, the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still.\n","Processing asent: \"Wacco!\" \"Like a bomb!\" \"Whee-aa-oo!\"\n","Processing asent: Not for five minutes could they drag themselves away from this triumph.\n","Processing asent: But they left at last.\n","Processing asent: The way to the top was easy after that.\n","Processing asent: As they reached the last stretch Ralph stopped.\n","Processing asent: \"Golly!\"\n","Processing asent: They were on the lip of a circular hollow in the side of the mountain.\n","Processing asent: This was filled with a blue flower, a rock plant of some sort, and the overflow hung down the vent and spilled lavishly among the canopy of the forest.\n","Processing asent: The air was thick with butterflies, lifting, fluttering, settling.\n","Processing asent: Beyond the hollow was the square top of the mountain and soon they were standing on it.\n","Processing asent: They had guessed before that this was an island: clambering among the pink rocks, with the sea on either side, and the crystal heights of air, they had known by some instinct that the sea lay on every side.\n","Processing asent: But there seemed something more fitting in leaving the last word till they stood on the top, and could see a circular horizon of water.\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned to the others.\n","Processing asent: \"This belongs to us.\"\n","Processing asent: It was roughly boat-shaped: humped near this end with behind them the jumbled descent to the shore.\n","Processing asent: On either side rocks, cliffs, treetops and a steep slope: forward there, the length of the boat, a tamer descent, tree-clad, with hints of pink: and then the jungly flat of the island, dense green, but drawn at the end to a pink tail.\n","Processing asent: There, where the island petered out in water, was another island; a rock, almost detached, standing like a fort, facing them across the green with one bold, pink bastion.\n","Processing asent: The boys surveyed all this, then looked out to sea.\n","Processing asent: They were high up and the afternoon had advanced; the view was not robbed of sharpness by mirage.\n","Processing asent: \"That's a reef. A coral reef. I've seen pictures like that.\"\n","Processing asent: The reef enclosed more than one side of the island, lying perhaps a mile out and parallel to what they now thought of as their beach.\n","Processing asent: The coral was scribbled in the sea as though a giant had bent down to reproduce the shape of the island in a flowing chalk line but tired before he had finished.\n","Processing asent: Inside was peacock water, rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium; outside was the dark blue of the sea.\n","Processing asent: The tide was running so that long streaks of foam tailed away from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was moving steadily astern.\n","Processing asent: Jack pointed down.\n","Processing asent: \"That's where we landed.\"\n","Processing asent: Beyond falls and cliffs there was a gash visible in the trees; there were the splintered trunks and then the drag, leaving only a fringe of palm between the scar and the sea.\n","Processing asent: There, too, jutting into the lagoon, was the platform, with insect-like figures moving near it.\n","Processing asent: Ralph sketched a twining line from the bald spot on which they stood down a slope, a gully, through flowers, round and down to the rock where the scar started.\n","Processing asent: \"That's the quickest way back.\"\n","Processing asent: Eyes shining, mouths open, triumphant, they savored the right of domination.\n","Processing asent: They were lifted up: were friends.\n","Processing asent: \"There's no village smoke, and no boats,\" said Ralph wisely.\n","Processing asent: \"We'll make sure later; but I think it's uninhabited.\" \"We'll get food,\" cried Jack.\n","Processing asent: \"Hunt. Catch things. until they fetch us.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon looked at them both, saying nothing but nodding till his black hair flopped backwards and forwards: his face was glowing.\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked down the other way where there was no reef.\n","Processing asent: \"Steeper,\" said Jack.\n","Processing asent: Ralph made a cupping gesture.\n","Processing asent: \"That bit of forest down there . . . the mountain holds it up.\"\n","Processing asent: Every point of the mountain held up trees--flowers and trees. Now the forest stirred, roared, flailed. The nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and for half a minute the breeze blew cool on their faces. Ralph spread his arms. \"All ours.\"\n","Processing asent: They laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain. \"I'm hungry.\"\n","Processing asent: When Simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs. \"Come on,\" said Ralph. \"We've found out what we wanted to know.\"\n","Processing asent: They scrambled down a rock slope, dropped among flowers and made their way under the trees. Here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously. Simon spoke first. \"Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle buds.\"\n","Processing asent: The bushes were dark evergreen and aromatic and the many buds were waxen green and folded up against the light. Jack slashed at one with his knife and the scent spilled over them. \"Candle buds.\" \"You couldn't light them,\" said Ralph. \"They just look like candles.\" \"Green candles,\" said Jack contemptuously. \"We can't eat them. Come on.\"\n","Processing asent: They were in the beginnings of the thick forest, plonking with weary feet on a track, when they heard the noises--squeakings--and the hard strike of hoofs on a path.\n","Processing asent: As they pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy.\n","Processing asent: They found a piglet caught in a curtain of creepers, throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror.\n","Processing asent: Its voice was thin, needle-sharp and insistent; The three boys rushed forward and Jack drew his knife again with a flourish.\n","Processing asent: He raised his arm in the air.\n","Processing asent: There came a pause, a hiatus, the pig continued to scream and the creepers to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm.\n","Processing asent: The pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the downward stroke would be.\n","Processing asent: Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the undergrowth.\n","Processing asent: They were left looking at each other and the place of terror.\n","Processing asent: Jack's face was white under the freckles.\n","Processing asent: He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the sheath.\n","Processing asent: Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track.\n","Processing asent: \"I was choosing a place,\" said Jack.\n","Processing asent: \"I was just waiting for a moment to decide where to stab him.\" \"You should stick a pig,\" said Ralph fiercely.\n","Processing asent: \"They always talk about sticking a pig.\" \"You cut a pig's throat to let the blood out,\" said Jack, \"otherwise you can't eat the meat.\" \"Why didn't you--?\"\n","Processing asent: They knew very well why he hadn't: because of the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood. \"I was going to,\" said Jack. He was ahead of them, and they could not see his face. \"I was choosing a place. Next time--!\"\n","Processing asent: He snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk.\n","Processing asent: Next time there would be no mercy.\n","Processing asent: He looked round fiercely, daring them to contradict.\n","Processing asent: Then they broke out into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food as they moved down the scar toward the platform and the meeting.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER TWO  Fire on the Mountain By the time Ralph finished blowing the conch the platform was crowded.\n","Processing asent: There were differences between this meeting and the one held in the morning.\n","Processing asent: The afternoon sun slanted in from the other side of the platform and most of the children, feeling too late the smart of sunburn, had put their clothes on.\n","Processing asent: The choir, less of a group, had discarded their cloaks.\n","Processing asent: Ralph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun.\n","Processing asent: On his right were most of the choir; on his left the larger boys who had not known each other before the evacuation; before him small children squatted in the grass.\n","Processing asent: Silence now.\n","Processing asent: Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a sudden breeze scattered light over the platform.\n","Processing asent: He was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting.\n","Processing asent: He looked sideways to his left, toward the bathing pool.\n","Processing asent: Piggy was sitting near but giving no help.\n","Processing asent: Ralph cleared his throat.\n","Processing asent: \"Well then.\"\n","Processing asent: All at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say.\n","Processing asent: He passed a hand through his fair hair and spoke.\n","Processing asent: \"We're on an island. We've been on the mountain top and seen water all round. We saw no houses, no smoke, no footprints, no boats, no people. We're on an uninhabited island with no other people on it.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack broke in.\n","Processing asent: \"All the same you need an army--for hunting. Hunting pigs--\" \"Yes. There are pigs on the island.\"\n","Processing asent: All three of them tried to convey the sense of the pink live thing struggling in the creepers.\n","Processing asent: \"We saw--\" \"Squealing--\" \"It broke away--\" \"Before I could kill it--but--next time!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack slammed his knife into a trunk and looked round challengingly.\n","Processing asent: The meeting settled down again.\n","Processing asent: \"So you see,\" said Ralph, \"We need hunters to get us meat. And another thing.\"\n","Processing asent: He lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sun-slashed faces.\n","Processing asent: \"There aren't any grownups. We shall have to look after ourselves.\"\n","Processing asent: The meeting hummed and was silent.\n","Processing asent: \"And another thing. We can't have everybody talking at once. We'll have to have 'Hands up' like at school.\"\n","Processing asent: He held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth.\n","Processing asent: \"Then I'll give him the conch.\" \"Conch?\" \"That's what this shell's called. I'll give the conch to the next person to speak. He can hold it when he's speaking.\" \"But--\" \"Look--\" \"And he won't be interrupted: Except by me.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack was on his feet.\n","Processing asent: \"We'll have rules!\" he cried excitedly.\n","Processing asent: \"Lots of rules! Then when anyone breaks 'em--\" \"Whee--oh!\" \"Wacco!\" \"Bong!\" \"Doink!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph felt the conch lifted from his lap. Then Piggy was standing cradling the great cream shell and the shouting died down. Jack, left on his feet, looked uncertainly at Ralph who smiled and patted the log. Jack sat down. Piggy took off his glasses and blinked at the assembly while he wiped them on his shirt. \"You're hindering Ralph. You're not letting him get to the most important thing.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused effectively. \"Who knows we're here? Eh?\" \"They knew at the airport.\" \"The man with a trumpet-thing--\" \"My dad.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy put on his glasses. \"Nobody knows where we are,\" said Piggy. He was paler than before and breathless. \"Perhaps they knew where we was going to; and perhaps not. But they don't know where we are 'cos we never got there.\"\n","Processing asent: He gaped at them for a moment, then swayed and sat down. Ralph took the conch from his hands. \"That's what I was going to say,\" he went on, \"when you all, all. . . .\"\n","Processing asent: He gazed at their intent faces. \"The plane was shot down in flames. Nobody knows where we are. We may be here a long time.\"\n","Processing asent: The silence was so complete that they could hear the unevenness of Piggy's breathing. The sun slanted in and lay golden over half the platform. The breezes that on the lagoon had chased their tails like kittens were finding their way across the platform and into the forest. Ralph pushed back the tangle of fair hair that hung on his forehead. \"So we may be here a long time.\"\n","Processing asent: Nobody said anything. He grinned suddenly. \"But this is a good island. We--Jack, Simon and me-- we climbed the mountain. It's wizard. There's food and drink, and--\" \"Rocks--\" \"Blue flowers--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy, partly recovered, pointed to the conch in Ralph's hands, and Jack and Simon fell silent. Ralph went on. \"While we're waiting we can have a good time on this island.\"\n","Processing asent: He gesticulated widely. \"It's like in a book.\"\n","Processing asent: At once there was a clamor. \"Treasure Island--\" \"Swallows and Amazons--\" \"Coral Island--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph waved the conch. \"This is our island. It's a good island. Until the grownups come to fetch us we'll have fun.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack held out his hand for the conch. \"There's pigs,\" he said. \"There's food; and bathing water in that little stream along there--and everything. Didn't anyone find anything else?\"\n","Processing asent: He handed the conch back to Ralph and sat down. Apparently no one had found anything. The older boys first noticed the child when he resisted. There was a group of little boys urging him forward and he did not want to go. He was a shrimp of a boy, about six years old, and one side of his face was blotted out by a mulberry-colored birthmark. He stood now, warped out of the perpendicular by the fierce light of publicity, and he bored into the coarse grass with one toe. He was muttering and about to cry. The other little boys, whispering but serious, pushed him toward Ralph. \"All right,\" said Ralph, \"come on then.\"\n","Processing asent: The small boy looked round in panic. \"Speak up!\"\n","Processing asent: The small boy held out his hands for the conch and the assembly shouted with laughter; at once he snatched back his hands and started to cry. \"Let him have the conch!\" shouted Piggy. \"Let him have it!\"\n","Processing asent: At last Ralph induced him to hold the shell but by then the blow of laughter had taken away the child's voice. Piggy knelt by him, one hand on the great shell, listening and interpreting to the assembly. \"He wants to know what you're going to do about the snake-thing.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph laughed, and the other boys laughed with him. The small boy twisted further into himself. \"Tell us about the snake-thing.\" \"Now he says it was a beastie.\" \"Beastie?'' \"A snake-thing.\n","Processing asent: Ever so big.\n","Processing asent: He saw it.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Where?\" \"In the woods.\n","Processing asent: \" Either the wandering breezes or perhaps the decline of the sun allowed a little coolness to lie under the trees. The boys felt it and stirred restlessly. \"You couldn't have a beastie, a snake-thing, on an island this size,\" Ralph explained kindly. \"You only get them in big countries, like Africa, or India.\n","Processing asent: \" Murmur; and the grave nodding of heads. \"He says the beastie came in the dark.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Then he couldn't see it!\"\n","Processing asent: Laughter and cheers. \"Did you hear that?\n","Processing asent: Says he saw the thing in the dark--\" \"He still says he saw the beastie. It came and went away again an' came back and wanted to eat him--\" \"He was dreaming.\n","Processing asent: \" Laughing, Ralph looked for confirmation round the ring of faces. The older boys agreed; but here and there among the little ones was the doubt that required more than rational assurance. \"He must have had a nightmare.\n","Processing asent: Stumbling about among all those creepers.\n","Processing asent: \" More grave nodding; they knew about nightmares. \"He says he saw the beastie, the snake-thing, and will it come back tonight?\" \"But there isn't a beastie!\" \"He says in the morning it turned into them things like ropes in the trees and hung in the branches.\n","Processing asent: He says will it come back tonight?\" \"But there isn't a beastie!\"\n","Processing asent: There was no laughter at all now and more grave watching. Ralph pushed both hands through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation. Jack seized the conch. \"Ralph's right of course.\n","Processing asent: There isn't a snake-thing.\n","Processing asent: But if there was a snake we'd hunt it and kill it.\n","Processing asent: We're going to hunt pigs to get meat for everybody.\n","Processing asent: And we'll look for the snake too--\" \"But there isn't a snake!\" \"We'll make sure when we go hunting.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph was annoyed and, for the moment, defeated. He felt himself facing something ungraspable. The eyes that looked so intently at him were without humor. \"But there isn't a beast!\"\n","Processing asent: Something he had not known was there rose in him and compelled him to make the point, loudly and again. \"But I tell you there isn't a beast!\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly was silent. Ralph lifted the conch again and his good humor came back as he thought of what he had to say next. \"Now we come to the most important thing. I've been thinking. I was thinking while we were climbing the mountain.\"\n","Processing asent: He flashed a conspiratorial grin at the other two. \"And on the beach just now. This is what I thought. We want to have fun. And we want to be rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: The passionate noise of agreement from the assembly hit him like a wave and he lost his thread. He thought again. \"We want to be rescued; and of course we shall be rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: Voices babbled. The simple statement, unbacked by any proof but the weight of Ralph's new authority, brought light and happiness. He had to wave the conch before he could make them hear him. \"My father's in the Navy. He said there aren't any unknown islands left. He says the Queen has a big room full of maps and all the islands in the world are drawn there. So the Queen's got a picture of this island.\"\n","Processing asent: Again came the sounds of cheerfulness and better heart. \"And sooner or later a ship will put in here. It might even be Daddy's ship. So you see, sooner or later, we shall be rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused, with the point made. The assembly was lifted toward safety by his words. They liked and now respected him. Spontaneously they began to clap and presently the platform was loud with applause. Ralph flushed, looking sideways at Piggy's open admiration, and then the other way at Jack who was smirking and showing that he too knew how to clap. Ralph waved the conch. \"Shut up! Wait! Listen!\"\n","Processing asent: He went on in the silence, borne on his triumph. \"There's another thing. We can help them to find us. If a ship comes near the island they may not notice us. So we must make smoke on top of the mountain. We must make a fire.\" \"A fire! Make a fire!\"\n","Processing asent: At once half the boys were on their feet. Jack clamored among them, the conch forgotten. \"Come on! Follow me!\"\n","Processing asent: The space under the palm trees was full of noise and movement. Ralph was on his feet too, shouting for quiet, but no one heard him. All at once the crowd swayed toward the island and was gone--following Jack. Even the tiny children went and did their best among the leaves and broken branches. Ralph was left, holding the conch, with no one but Piggy. Piggy's breathing was quite restored. \"Like kids!\" he said scornfully. \"Acting like a crowd of kids!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him doubtfully and laid the conch on the tree trunk. \"I bet it's gone tea-time,\" said Piggy. \"What do they think they're going to do on that mountain?\"\n","Processing asent: He caressed the shell respectfully, then stopped and looked up. \"Ralph!\n","Processing asent: Hey!\n","Processing asent: Where you going?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph was already clambering over the first smashed swathes of the scar. A long way ahead of him was crashing and laughter. Piggy watched him in disgust. \"Like a crowd of kids--\"\n","Processing asent: He sighed, bent, and laced up his shoes. The noise of the errant assembly faded up the mountain. Then, with the martyred expression of a parent who has to keep up with the senseless ebullience of the children, he picked up the conch, turned toward the forest, and began to pick his way over the tumbled scar. Below the other side of the mountain top was a platform of forest. Once more Ralph found himself making the cupping gesture. \"Down there we could get as much wood as we want.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack nodded and pulled at his underlip. Starting perhaps a hundred feet below them on the steeper side of the mountain, the patch might have been designed expressly for fuel. Trees, forced by the damp heat, found too little soil for full growth, fell early and decayed: creepers cradled them, and new saplings searched a way up. Jack turned to the choir, who stood ready. Their black caps of maintenance were slid over one ear like berets. \"We'll build a pile.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: \" They found the likeliest path down and began tugging at the dead wood. And the small boys who had reached the top came sliding too till everyone but Piggy was busy. Most of the wood was so rotten that when they pulled, it broke up into a shower of fragments and woodlice and decay; but some trunks came out in one piece. The twins, Sam 'n Eric, were the first to get a likely log but they could do nothing till Ralph, Jack, Simon, Roger and Maurice found room for a hand-hold. Then they inched the grotesque dead thing up the rock and toppled it over on top. Each party of boys added a quota, less or more, and the pile grew. At the return Ralph found himself alone on a limb with Jack and they grinned at each other, sharing this burden. Once more, amid the breeze, the shouting, the slanting sunlight on the high mountain, was shed that glamour, that strange invisible light of friendship, adventure, and content. \"Almost too heavy.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack grinned back. \"Not for the two of us.\"\n","Processing asent: Together, joined in an effort by the burden, they staggered up the last steep Of the mountain. Together, they chanted One! Two! Three! and crashed the log on to the great pile. Then they stepped back, laughing with triumphant pleasure, so that immediately Ralph had to stand on his head. Below them, boys were still laboring, though some of the small ones had lost interest and were searching this new forest for fruit. Now the twins, with unsuspected intelligence, came up the mountain with armfuls of dried leaves and dumped them against the pile. One by one, as they sensed that the pile was complete, the boys stopped going back for more and stood, with the pink, shattered top of the mountain around them. Breath came evenly by now, and sweat dried. Ralph and Jack looked at each other while society paused about them. The shameful knowledge grew in them and they did not know how to begin confession. Ralph spoke first, crimson in the face. \"Will you?\"\n","Processing asent: He cleared his throat and went on. \"Will you light the fire?\"\n","Processing asent: Now the absurd situation was open, Jack blushed too. He began to mutter vaguely. \"You rub two sticks. You rub--\"\n","Processing asent: He glanced at Ralph, who blurted out the last confession of incompetence. \"Has anyone got any matches?\" \"You make a bow and spin the arrow,\" said Roger. He rubbed his hands in mime. \"Psss. Psss.\"\n","Processing asent: A little air was moving over the mountain. Piggy came with it, in shorts and shirt, laboring cautiously out of the forest with the evening sunlight gleaming from his glasses. He held the conch under his arm. Ralph shouted at him. \"Piggy! Have you got any matches?\"\n","Processing asent: The other boys took up the cry till the mountain rang. Piggy shook his head and came to the pile. \"My! You've made a big heap, haven't you?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack pointed suddenly. \"His specs--use them as burning glasses!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy was surrounded before he could back away. \"Here--let me go!\"\n","Processing asent: His voice rose to a shriek of terror as Jack snatched the glasses off his face. \"Mind out! Give 'em back! I can hardly see! You'll break the conch!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph elbowed him to ne side and knelt by the pile. \"Stand out of the light.\"\n","Processing asent: There was pushing and pulling and officious cries. Ralph moved the lenses back and forth, this way and that, till a glossy white image of the declining sun lay on a piece of rotten wood. Almost at once a thin trickle of smoke rose up and made him cough. Jack knelt too and blew gently, so that the smoke drifted away, thickening, and a tiny flame appeared. The flame, nearly invisible at first in that bright sunlight, enveloped a small twig, grew, was enriched with color and reached up to a branch which exploded with a sharp crack. The flame flapped higher and the boys broke into a cheer. \"My specs!\" howled Piggy. \"Give me my specs!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood away from the pile and put the glasses into Piggy's groping hands. His voice subsided to a mutter. \"Jus' blurs, that's all. Hardly see my hand--\"\n","Processing asent: The boys were dancing. The pile was so rotten, and now so tinder-dry, that whole limbs yielded passionately to the yellow flames that poured upwards and shook a great beard of flame twenty feet in the air. For yards round the fire the heat was like a blow, and the breeze was a river of sparks. Trunks crumbled to white dust. Ralph shouted. \"More wood!\n","Processing asent: All of you get more wood!\"\n","Processing asent: Life became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest. To keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked further. Even the smallest boys, unless fruit claimed them, brought little pieces of wood and threw them in. The air moved a little faster and became a light wind, so that leeward and windward side were clearly differentiated. On one side the air was cool, but on the other the fire thrust out a savage arm of heat that crinkled hair on the instant. Boys who felt the evening wind on their damp faces paused to enjoy the freshness of it and then found they were exhausted. They flung themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered rocks. The beard of flame diminished quickly; then the pile fell inwards with a soft, cindery sound, and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leaned away and drifted downwind. The boys lay, panting like dogs. Ralph raised his head off his forearms. \"That was no good.\n","Processing asent: \" Roger spat efficiently into the hot dust. \"What d'you mean?\" \"There wasn't any smoke.\n","Processing asent: Only flame.\n","Processing asent: \" Piggy had settled himself in a space between two rocks, and sat with the conch on his knees. \"We haven't made a fire,\" he said, \"what's any use.\n","Processing asent: We couldn't keep a fire like that going, not if we tried.\n","Processing asent: \" \"A fat lot you tried,\" said Jack contemptuously. \"You just sat.\n","Processing asent: \" \"We used his specs,\" said Simon, smearing a black cheek with his forearm. \"He helped that way.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I got the conch,\" said Piggy indignantly. \"You let me speak!\" \"The conch doesn't count on top of the mountain,\" said Jack, \"so you shut up.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I got the conch in my hand.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Put on green branches,\" said Maurice. \"That's the best way to make smoke.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I got the conch--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack turned fiercely. \"You shut up!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy wilted. Ralph took the conch from him and looked round the circle of boys. \"We've got to have special people for looking after the fire. Any day there may be a ship out there\"--he waved his arm at the taut wire of the horizon--\"and if we have a signal going they'll come and take us off. And another thing. We ought to have more rules. Where the conch is, that's a meeting. The same up here as down there.\"\n","Processing asent: They assented. Piggy opened his mouth to speak, caught Jack's eye and shut it again. Jack held out his hands for the conch and stood up, holding the delicate thing carefully in his sooty hands. \"I agree with Ralph. We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything. So we've got to do the right things.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned to Ralph. \"Ralph, I'll split up the choir--my hunters, that is--into groups, and we'll be responsible for keeping the fire going--\"\n","Processing asent: This generosity brought a spatter of applause from the boys, so that Jack grinned at them, then waved the conch for silence. \"We'll let the fire burn out now.\n","Processing asent: Who would see smoke at night-time, anyway?\n","Processing asent: And we can start the fire again whenever we like.\n","Processing asent: Altos, you can keep the fire going this week, and trebles the next--\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly assented gravely. \"And we'll be responsible for keeping a lookout too. If we see a ship out there\"--they followed the direction of his bony arm with their eyes--\"we'll put green branches on. Then there'll be more smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: They gazed intently at the dense blue of the horizon, as if a little silhouette might appear there at any moment. The sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer the sill of the world. All at once they were aware of the evening as the end of light and warmth. Roger took the conch and looked round at them gloomily. \"I've been watching the sea. There hasn't been the trace of a ship. Perhaps we'll never be rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: A murmur rose and swept away. Ralph took back the conch. \"I said before we'll be rescued sometime. We've just got to wait, that's all.\"\n","Processing asent: Daring, indignant, Piggy took the conch. \"That's what I said! I said about our meetings and things and then you said shut up--\"\n","Processing asent: His voice lifted into the whine of virtuous recrimination. They stirred and began to shout him down. \"You said you wanted a small fire and you been and built a pile like a hayrick.\n","Processing asent: If I say anything,\" cried Piggy, with bitter realism, \"you say shut up; but if Jack or Maurice or Simon--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused in the tumult, standing, looking beyond them and down the unfriendly side of the mountain to the great patch where they had found dead wood. Then he laughed so strangely that they were hushed, looking at the flash of his spectacles in astonishment. They followed his gaze to find the sour joke. \"You got your small fire all right.\n","Processing asent: \" Smoke was rising here and there among the creepers that festooned the dead or dying trees. As they watched, a flash of fire appeared at the root of one wisp, and then the smoke thickened. Small flames stirred at the trunk of a tree and crawled away through leaves and brushwood, dividing and increasing. One patch touched a tree trunk and scrambled up like a bright squirrel. The smoke increased, sifted, rolled outwards. The squirrel leapt on the wings of the wind and clung to another standing tree, eating downwards. Beneath the dark canopy of leaves and smoke the fire laid hold on the forest and began to gnaw. Acres of black and yellow smoke rolled steadily toward the sea. At the sight of the flames and the irresistible course of the fire, the boys broke into shrill, excited cheering. The flames, as though they were a kind of wild life, crept as a jaguar creeps on its belly toward a line of birch-like saplings that fledged an outcrop of the pink rock. They flapped at the first of the trees, and the branches grew a brief foliage of fire. The heart of flame leapt nimbly across the gap between the trees and then went swinging and flaring along the whole row of them. Beneath the capering boys a quarter of a mile square of forest was savage with smoke and flame. The separate noises of the fire merged into a drum-roll that seemed to shake the mountain. \"You got your small fire all right.\n","Processing asent: \" Startled, Ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent, feeling the beginnings of awe at the power set free below them. The knowledge and the awe made him savage. \"Oh, shut up!\" \"I got the conch,\" said Piggy, in a hurt voice. \"I got a right to speak.\n","Processing asent: \" They looked at him with eyes that lacked interest in what they saw, and cocked ears at the drum-roll of the fire. Piggy glanced nervously into hell and cradled the conch. \"We got to let that burn out now.\n","Processing asent: And that was our firewood.\n","Processing asent: \" He licked his lips. \"There ain't nothing we can do.\n","Processing asent: We ought to be more careful.\n","Processing asent: I'm scared--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack dragged his eyes away from the fire. \"You're always scared. Yah--Fatty!\" \"I got the conch,\" said Piggy bleakly. He turned to Ralph. \"I got the conch, ain't I Ralph?\"\n","Processing asent: Unwillingly Ralph turned away from the splendid, awful sight. \"What's that?\" \"The conch.\n","Processing asent: I got a right to speak.\n","Processing asent: \" The twins giggled together. \"We wanted smoke--\" \"Now look--!\"\n","Processing asent: A pall stretched for miles away from the island. All the boys except Piggy started to giggle; presently they were shrieking with laughter. Piggy lost his temper. \"I got the conch!\n","Processing asent: Just you listen!\n","Processing asent: The first thing we ought to have made was shelters down there by the beach.\n","Processing asent: It wasn't half cold down there in the night.\n","Processing asent: But the first time Ralph says 'fire' you goes howling and screaming up this here mountain.\n","Processing asent: Like a pack of kids!\"\n","Processing asent: By now they were listening to the tirade. \"How can you expect to be rescued if you don't put first things first and act proper?\"\n","Processing asent: He took off his glasses and made as if to put down the conch; but the sudden motion toward it of most of the older boys changed his mind. He tucked the shell under his arm, and crouched back on a rock. \"Then when you get here you build a bonfire that isn't no use.\n","Processing asent: Now you been and set the whole island on fire.\n","Processing asent: Won't we look funny if the whole island burns up?\n","Processing asent: Cooked fruit, that's what we'll have to eat, and roast pork.\n","Processing asent: And that's nothing to laugh at!\n","Processing asent: You said Ralph was chief and you don't give him time to think.\n","Processing asent: Then when he says something you rush off, like, like--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for breath, and the fire growled at them. \"And that's not all. Them kids. The little 'uns. Who took any notice of 'em? Who knows how many we got?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph took a sudden step forward. \"I told you to. I told you to get a list of names!\" \"How could I,\" cried Piggy indignantly, \"all by myself? They waited for two minutes, then they fell in the sea; they went into the forest; they just scattered everywhere. How was I to know which was which?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph licked pale lips. \"Then you don't know how many of us there ought to be?\" \"How could I with them little 'uns running round like insects? Then when you three came back, as soon as you said make a fire, they all ran away, and I never had a chance--\" \"That's enough!\" said Ralph sharply, and snatched back the conch. \"If you didn't you didn't.\" \"--then you come up here an' pinch my specs--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack turned on him. \"You shut up!\" \"--and them little 'uns was wandering about down there where the fire is. How d'you know they aren't still there?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy stood up and pointed to the smoke and flames. A murmur rose among the boys and died away. Something strange was happening to Piggy, for he was gasping for breath. \"That little 'un--\" gasped Piggy--\"him with the mark on his face, I don't see him. Where is he now?\"\n","Processing asent: The crowd was as silent as death. \"Him that talked about the snakes. He was down there--\"\n","Processing asent: A tree exploded in the fire like a bomb. Tall swathes of creepers rose for a moment into view, agonized, and went down again. The little boys screamed at them. \"Snakes! Snakes! Look at the snakes!\"\n","Processing asent: In the west, and unheeded, the sun lay only an inch or two above the sea. Their faces were lit redly from beneath. Piggy fell against a rock and clutched it with both hands. \"That little 'un that had a mark on his face--where is--he now? I tell you I don't see him.\"\n","Processing asent: The boys looked at each other fearfully, unbelieving. \"--where is he now?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph muttered the reply as if in shame. \"Perhaps he went back to the, the--\"\n","Processing asent: Beneath them, on the unfriendly side of the mountain, the drum-roll continued. CHAPTER THREE  Huts on the Beach Jack was bent double. He was down like a sprinter, his nose only a few inches from the humid earth. The tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themlves in a green dusk thirty feet above him, and all about was the undergrowth. There was only the faintest indication of a trail here; a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a hoof. He lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to him. Then dog-like, uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort, he stole forward five yards and stopped. Here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node. The tendril was polished on the underside; pigs, passing through the loop, brushed it with their bristly hide. Jack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue, then stared forward into the semi-darkness of the undergrowth. His sandy hair, considerably longer than it had been when they dropped in, was lighter now; and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and peeling sunburn. A sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand, and except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife-belt he was naked. He closed his eyes, raised his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils, assessing the current of warm air for information. The forest and he were very still. At length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes. They were bright blue, eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad. He passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest. Then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground. The silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat, and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects. Only when Jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages. Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly. By the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked, closed his eyes, and once more drew in the warm air; and this time his breath came short, there was even a passing pallor in his face, and then the surge of blood again. He passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched, looking down at the trodden ground at his feet. The droppings were warm. They lay piled among turned earth. They were olive green, smooth, and they steamed a little. Jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail. Then he raised his spear and sneaked forward. Beyond the creeper, the trail joined a pig-run that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path. The ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as Jack rose to his full height he heard something moving on it. He swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his strength. From the pig-run came the quick, hard patter of hoofs, a castanet sound, seductive, maddening--the promise of meat. He rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his spear. The pattering of pig's trotters died away in the distance. Jack stood there, streaming with sweat, streaked with brown earth, stained by all the vicissitudes of a day's hunting. Swearing, he turned off the trail and pushed his way through until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm. Beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he could hear voices. Ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves, a rude shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down. He did not notice when Jack spoke. \"Got any water?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked up, frowning, from the complication of leaves. He did not notice Jack even when he saw him. \"I said have you got any water? I'm thirsty.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph withdrew his attention from the shelter and realized Jack with a start. \"Oh, hullo. Water? There by the tree. Ought to be some left.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack took up a coconut shell that brimmed with fresh water from among a group that was arranged in the shade, and drank. The water splashed over his chin and neck and chest. He breathed noisily when he had finished. \"Needed that.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon spoke from inside the shelter. \"Up a bit.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned to the shelter and lifted a branch with a whole tiling of leaves. The leaves came apart and fluttered down. Simon's contrite face appeared in the hole. \"Sorry.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph surveyed the wreck with distaste. \"Never get it done.\"\n","Processing asent: He flung himself down at Jack's feet. Simon remained, looking out of the hole in the shelter. Once down, Ralph explained. \"Been working for days now. And look!\"\n","Processing asent: Two shelters were in position, but shaky. This one was a ruin. \"And they keep running off. You remember the meeting? How everyone was going to work hard until the shelters were finished?\" \"Except me and my hunters--\" \"Except the hunters. Well, the littluns are--\"\n","Processing asent: He gesticulated, sought for a word. \"They're hopeless. The older ones aren't much better. D'you see? All day I've been working with Simon. No one else. They're off bathing, or eating, or playing.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon poked his head out carefully. \"You're chief. You tell 'em off.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky. \"Meetings. Don't we love meetings? Every day. Twice a day. We talk.\"\n","Processing asent: He got on one elbow. \"I bet if I blew the conch this minute, they'd come running. Then we'd be, you know, very solemn, and someone would say we ought to build a jet, or a submarine, or a TV set. When the meeting was over they'd work for five minutes, then wander off or go hunting.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack flushed. \"We want meat.\" \"Well, we haven't got any yet. And we want shelters. Besides, the rest of your hunters came back hours ago. They've been swimming.\" \"I went on,\" said Jack. \"I let them go. I had to go on. I--\"\n","Processing asent: He tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was swallowing him up. \"I went on. I thought, by myself--\"\n","Processing asent: The madness came into his eyes again. \"I thought I might--kill.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I thought I might.\"\n","Processing asent: Some hidden passion vibrated in Ralph's voice. \"But you haven't yet.\"\n","Processing asent: His invitation might have passed as casual, were it not for the undertone. \"You wouldn't care to help with the shelters, I suppose?\" \"We want meat--\" \"And we don't get it.\"\n","Processing asent: Now the antagonism was audible. \"But I shall! Next time! I've got to get a barb on this spear! We wounded a pig and the spear fell out. If we could only make barbs--\" \"We need shelters.\"\n","Processing asent: Suddenly Jack shouted in rage. \"Are you accusing--?\" \"All I'm saying is we've worked dashed hard. That's all.\"\n","Processing asent: They were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult. Ralph rolled on his stomach and began to play with the grass. \"If it rains like when we dropped in we'll need shelters all right. And then another thing. We need shelters because of the--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for a moment and they both pushed their anger away. Then he went on with the safe, changed subject. \"You've noticed, haven't you?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack put down his spear and squatted. \"Noticed what?\" \"Well. They're frightened.\"\n","Processing asent: He rolled over and peered into Jack's fierce, dirty face. \"I mean the way things are. They dream. You can hear 'em. Have you been awake at night?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack shook his head. \"They talk and scream. The littluns. Even some of the others. As if--\" \"As if it wasn't a good island.\"\n","Processing asent: Astonished at the interruption, they looked up at Simon's serious face. \"As if,\" said Simon, \"the beastie, the beastie or the snake-thing, was real. Remember?\"\n","Processing asent: The two older boys flinched when they heard the shameful syllable. Snakes were not mentioned now, were not mentionable. \"As if this wasn't a good island,\" said Ralph slowly. \"Yes, that's right.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack sat up and stretched out his legs. \"They're batty.\" \"Crackers. Remember when we went exploring?\"\n","Processing asent: They grinned at each other, remembering the glamour of the first day. Ralph went on. \"So we need shelters as a sort of--\" \"Home.\" \"That's right.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack drew up his legs, clasped his knees, and frowned in an effort to attain clarity. \"All the same--in the forest. I mean when you're hunting, not when you're getting fruit, of course, but when you're on your own--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for a moment, not sure if Ralph would take him seriously. \"Go on.\" \"If you're hunting sometimes you catch yourself feeling as if--\"\n","Processing asent: He flushed suddenly. \"There's nothing in it of course. Just a feeling. But you can feel as if you're not hunting, but-- being hunted, as if something's behind you all the time in the jungle.\"\n","Processing asent: They were silent again: Simon intent, Ralph incredulous and faintly indignant. He sat up, rubbing one shoulder with a dirty hand. \"Well, I don't know.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack leapt to his feet and spoke very quickly. \"That's how you can feel in the forest. Of course there's nothing in it. Only--only--\"\n","Processing asent: He took a few rapid steps toward the beach, then came back. \"Only I know how they feel. See? That's all.\" \"The best thing we can do is get ourselves rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack had to think for a moment before he could remember what rescue was. \"Rescue? Yes, of course! All the same, I'd like to catch a pig first--\"\n","Processing asent: He snatched up his spear and dashed it into the ground. The opaque, mad look came into his eyes again. Ralph looked at him critically through his tangle of fair hair. \"So long as your hunters remember the fire--\" \"You and your fire!\"\n","Processing asent: The two boys trotted down the beach, and, turning at the water's edge, looked back at the pink mountain. The trickle of smoke sketched a chalky line up the solid blue of the sky, wavered high up and faded. Ralph frowned. \"I wonder how far off you could see that.\" \"Miles.\" \"We don't make enough smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: The bottom part of the trickle, as though conscious of their gaze, thickened to a creamy blur which crept up the feeble column. \"They've put on green branches,\" muttered Ralph. \"I wonder!\"\n","Processing asent: He screwed up his eyes and swung round to search the horizon. \"Got it!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack shouted so loudly that Ralph jumped. \"What? Where? Is it a ship?\"\n","Processing asent: But Jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the mountain to the flatter part of the island. \"Of course! They'll lie up there--they must, when the sun's too hot--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph gazed bewildered at his rapt face. \"--they get up high. High up and in the shade, resting during the heat, like cows at home--\" \"I thought you saw a ship!\" \"We could steal up on one--paint our faces so they wouldn't see--perhaps surround them and then--\"\n","Processing asent: Indignation took away Ralph's control. \"I was talking about smoke! Don't you want to be rescued? All you can talk about is pig, pig, pig!\" \"But we want meat!\" \"And I work all day with nothing but Simon and you come back and don't even notice the huts!\" \"I was working too--\" \"But you like it!\" shouted Ralph. \"You want to hunt! While I--\"\n","Processing asent: They faced each other on the bright beach, astonished at the rub of feeling. Ralph looked away first, pretending interest in a group of littluns on the sand. From beyond the platform came the shouting of the hunters in the swimming pool. On the end of the platform, Piggy was lying flat, looking down into the brilliant water. \"People don't help much.\"\n","Processing asent: He wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were. \"Simon. He helps.\"\n","Processing asent: He pointed at the shelters. \"All the rest rushed off. He's done as much as I have. Only--\" \"Simon's always about.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph stared back to the shelters with Jack by his side. \"Do a bit for you,\" muttered Jack, \"before I have a bathe.\" \"Don't bother.\"\n","Processing asent: But when they reached the shelters Simon was not to be seen. Ralph put his head in the hole, withdrew it, and turned to Jack. \"He's buzzed off.\" \"Got fed up,\" said Jack, \"and gone for a bathe.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph frowned. \"He's queer. He's funny.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack nodded, as much for the sake of agreeing as anything, and by tacit consent they left the shelter and went toward the bathing pool. \"And then,\" said Jack, \"when I've had a bathe and something to eat, I'll just trek over to the other side of the mountain and see if I can see any traces. Coming?\" \"But the sun's nearly set!\" \"I might have time---\"\n","Processing asent: They walked along, two continents of experience and feeling, unable to communicate. \"If I could only get a pig!\" \"I'll come back and go on with the shelter.\"\n","Processing asent: They looked at each other, baffled, in love and hate. All the warm salt water of the bathing pool and the shouting and splashing and laughing were only just sufficient to bring them together again. Simon was not in the bathing pool as they had expected. When the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had followed them for a few yards and then stopped. He had stood frowing down at a pile of sand on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut. Then he turned his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose. He was a small, skinny boy, his chin pointed, and his eyes so bright they had deceived Ralph into thinking him delightfully gay and wicked. The coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down, almost concealing a low, broad forehead. He wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like Jack's. Always darkish in color, Simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat. He picked his way up the scar, passed the great rock where Ralph had climbed on the first morning, then turned off to his right among the trees. He walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees, where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal. Flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture. Here the littluns who had run after him caught up with him. They talked, cried out unintelligibly, lugged him toward the trees. Then, amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight, Simon found for them the fruit they could not reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back down to the endless, outstretched hands. When he had satisfied them he paused and looked round. The littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit. Simon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him. Soon high jungle closed in. Tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark canopy where life went on clamorously. The air here was dark too, and the creepers dropped their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships. His feet left prints in the soft soil and the creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them. He came at last to a place where more sunshine fell. Since they had not so far to go for light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle; for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants and ferns to grow. The whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes, and was a bowl of heat and light. A great tree, fallen across one corner, leaned against the trees that still stood and a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top. Simon paused. He looked over his shoulder as Jack had done at the close ways behind him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone. For a moment his movements were almost furtive. Then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of the mat. The creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they pulled together behind him. When he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin screened off from the open space by a few leaves. He squatted down, parted the leaves and looked out into the clearing. Nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air. Holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island. Evening was advancing toward the island; the sounds of the bright fantastic birds, the bee-sounds, even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square rocks, were fainter. The deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less perceptible than the susurration of the blood. Simon dropped the screen of leaves back into place. The slope of the bars of honeycolored sunlight decreased; they slid up the bushes, passed over the green candle-like buds, moved up toward the canopy, and darkness thickened under the trees. With the fading of the light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away. The candlebuds stirred. Their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet the open air. Now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky. Darkness poured out, submerging the ways between the trees till they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea. The candle-buds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked down from the first stars. Their scent spilled out into the air and took possession of the island. CHAPTER FOUR  Painted Faces and Long Hair The first rhythm that they became used to was the slow swing from dawn to quick dusk. They accepted the pleasures of morning, the bright sun, the whelming sea and sweet air, as a time when play was good and life so full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten. Toward noon, as the floods of light fell more nearly to the perpendicular, the stark colors of the morning were smoothed in pearl and opalescence; and the heat--as though the impending sun's height gave it momentum--became a blow that they ducked, running to the shade and lying there, perhaps even sleeping. Strange things happened at midday. The glittering sea rose up, moved apart in planes of blatant impossibility; the coral reef and the few stunted palms that clung to the more elevated parts would float up into the sky, would quiver, be plucked apart, run like raindrops on a wire or be repeated as in an odd succession of mirrors. Sometimes land loomed where there was no land and flicked out like a bubble as the children watched. Piggy discounted all this learnedly as a \"mirage\"; and since no boy could reach even the reef over the stretch of water where the snapping sharks waited, they grew accustomed to these mysteries and ignored them, just as they ignored the miraculous, throbbing stars. At midday the illusions merged into the sky and there the sun gazed down like an angry eye. Then, at the end of the afternoon; the mirage subsided and the horizon became level and blue and clipped as the sun declined. That was another time of comparative coolness but menaced by the coming of the dark. When the sun sank, darkness dropped on the island like an extinguisher and soon the shelters were full of restlessness, under the remote stars. Nevertheless, the northern European tradition of work, play, and food right through the day, made it possible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this new rhythm. The littlun Percival had early crawled into a shelter and stayed there for two days, talking, singing, and crying, till they thought him batty and were faintly amused. Ever since then he had been peaked, red-eyed, and miserable; a littiun who played little and cried often. The smaller boys were known now by the generic title of \"littluns.\"\n","Processing asent: The decrease in size, from Ralph down, was gradual; and though there was a dubious region inhabited by Simon and Robert and Maurice, nevertheless no one had any difficulty in recognizing biguns at one end and littluns at the other. The undoubted littluns, those aged about six, led a quite distinct, and at the same time intense, life of their own. They ate most of the day, picking fruit where they could reach it and not particular about ripeness and quality. They were used now to stomach-aches and a sort of chronic diarrhoea. They suffered untold terrors in the dark and huddled together for comfort. Apart from food and sleep, they found time for play, aimless and trivial, in the white sand by the bright water. They cried for their mothers much less often than might have been expected; they were very brown, and filthily dirty. They obeyed the summons of the conch, partly because Ralph blew it, and he was big enough to be a link with the adult world of authority; and partly because they enjoyed the entertainment of the assemblies. But otherwise they seldom bothered with the biguns and their passionately emotional and corporate life was their own. They had built castles in the sand at the bar of the little river. These castles were about one foot high and were decorated with shells, withered flowers, and interesting stones. Round the castles was a complex of marks, tracks, walls, railway lines, that were of significance only if inspected with the eye at beach-level. The littluns played here, if not happily at least with absorbed attention; and often as many as three of them would play the same game together. Three were playing here now. Henry was the biggest of them. He was also a distant relative of that other boy whose mulberry-marked face had not been seen since the evening of the great fire; but he was not old enough to understand this, and if he had been told that the other boy had gone home in an aircraft, he would have accepted the statement without fuss or disbelief. Henry was a bit of a leader this afternoon, because the other two were Percival and Johnny, the smallest boys on the island. Percival was mouse-colored and had not been very attractive even to his mother; Johnny was well built, with fair hair and a natural belligerence. Just now he was being obedient because he was interested; and the three children, kneeling in the sand, were at peace. Roger and Maurice came out of the forest. They were relieved from duty at the fire and had come down for a swim. Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones. Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction. The three littluns paused in their game and looked up. As it happened, the particular marks in which they were interested had not been touched, so they made no protest. Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away. In his other life Maurice had received chastisement for filling a younger eye with sand. Now, though there was no parent to let fall a heavy hand, Maurice still felt the unease of wrongdoing. At the back of his mind formed the uncertain outlines of an excuse. He muttered something about a swim and broke into a trot. Roger remained, watching the littluns. He was not noticeably darker than when he had dropped in, but the shock of black hair, down his nape and low on his forehead, seemed to suit his gloomy face and made what had seemed at first an unsociable remoteness into something forbidding. Percival finished his whimper and went on playing, for the tears had washed the sand away. Johnny watched him with china-blue eyes; then began to fling up sand in a shower, and presently Percival was crying again. When Henry tired of his play and wandered off along the beach, Roger followed him, keeping beneath the palms and drifting casually in the same direction. Henry walked at a distance from the palms and the shade because he was too young to keep himself out of the sun. He went down the beach and busied himself at the water's edge. The great Pacific tide was coming in and every few seconds the relatively still water of the lagoon heaved forwards an inch. There were creatures that lived in this last fling of the sea, tiny transparencies that came questing in with the water over the hot, dry sand. With impalpable organs of sense they examined this new field. Perhaps food had appeared where at the last incursion there had been none; bird droppings, insects perhaps, any of the strewn detritus of landward life. Like a myriad of tiny teeth in a saw, the transparencies came scavenging over the beach. This was fascinating to Henry. He poked about with a bit of stick, that itself was waveworn and whitened and a vagrant, and tried to control the motions of the scavengers. He made little runnels that the tide filled and tried to crowd them with creatures. He became absorbed beyond mere happiness as he felt himself exercising control over living things. He talked to them, urging them, ordering them. Driven back by the tide, his footprints became bays in which they were trapped and gave him the illusion of mastery. He squatted on his hams at the water's edge, bowed, with a shock of hair falling over his forehead and past his eyes, and the afternoon sun emptied down invisible arrows. Roger waited too. At first he had hidden behind a great palm; but Henry's absorption with the transparencies was so obvious that at last he stood out in full view. He looked along the beach. Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles, He sat there, crooning to himself and throwing sand at an imaginary Percival. Beyond him, Roger could see the platform and the glints of spray where Ralph and Simon and Piggy and Maurice were diving in the pool. He listened carefully but could only just hear them. A sudden breeze shook the fringe of palm trees, so that the fronds tossed and fluttered. Sixty feet above Roger, several nuts, fibrous lumps as big as rugby balls, were loosed from their stems. They fell about him with a series of hard thumps and he was not touched. Roger did not consider his escape, but looked from the nuts to Henry and back again. The subsoil beneath the palm trees was a raised beach, and generations of palms had worked loose in this the stones that had lain on the sands of another shore. Roger stooped, picked up a stone, aimed, and threw it at Henry-- threw it to miss. The stone, that token of preposterous time, bounced five yards to Henry's right and fell in the water. Roger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them. Yet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw. Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law. Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilization that knew nothing of him and was in ruins. Henry was surprised by the plopping sounds in the water. He abandoned the noiseless transparencies and pointed at the center of the spreading rings like a setter. This side and that the stones fell, and Henry turned obediently but always too late to see the stones in the air. At last he saw one and laughed, looking for the friend who was teasing him. But Roger had whipped behind the palm again, was leaning against it breathing quickly, his eyelids fluttering. Then Henry lost interest in stones and wandered off. \"Roger.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack was standing under a tree about ten yards away. When Roger opened his eyes and saw him, a darker shadow crept beneath the swarthiness of his skin; but Jack noticed nothing. He was eager, impatient, beckoning, so that Roger went to him. There was a small pool at the end of the river, dammed back by sand and full of white water-lilies and needle-like reeds. Here Sam and Eric were waiting, and Bill. Jack, concealed from the sun, knelt by the pool and opened the two large leaves that he carried. One of them contained white clay, and the other red. By them lay a stick of charcoal brought down from the fire. Jack explained to Roger as he worked. \"They don't smell me. They see me, I think. Something pink, under the trees.\"\n","Processing asent: He smeared on the clay. \"If only I'd some green!\"\n","Processing asent: He turned a half-concealed face up to Roger and answered the incomprehension of his gaze. \"For hunting. Like in the war. You know--dazzle paint. Like things trying to look like something else--\"\n","Processing asent: He twisted in the urgency of telling. \"--Like moths on a tree trunk.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger understood and nodded gravely. The twins moved toward Jack and began to protest timidly about something. Jack waved them away. \"Shut up.\"\n","Processing asent: He rubbed the charcoal stick between the patches of red and white on his face. \"No. You two come with me.\"\n","Processing asent: He peered at his reflection and disliked it. He bent down, took up a double handful of lukewarm water and rubbed the mess from his face. Freckles and sandy eyebrows appeared. Roger smiled, unwillingly. \"You don't half look a mess.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack planned his new face. He made one cheek and one eye-socket white, then he rubbed red over the other half of his face and slashed a black bar of charcoal across from right ear to left jaw. He looked in the pool for his reflection, but his breathing troubled the mirror. \"Samneric. Get me a coconut. An empty one.\"\n","Processing asent: He knelt, holding the shell of water. A rounded patch of sunlight fell on his face and a brightness appeared in the depths of the water. He looked in astonishment, no longer at himself but at an awesome stranger. He spilt the water and leapt to his feet, laughing excitedly. Beside the pool his sinewy body held up a mask that drew their eyes and appalled them. He began to dance and his laughter became a bloodthirsty snarling. He capered toward Bill, and the mask was a thing on its own, behind which Jack hid, liberated from shame and selfconsciousness. The face of red and white and black swung through the air and jigged toward Bill. Bill started up laughing; then suddenly he fell silent and blundered away through the bushes. Jack rushed toward the twins. \"The rest are making a line. Come on!\" \"But--\" \"--we--\" \"Come on! I'll creep up and stab--\"\n","Processing asent: The mask compelled them. Ralph climbed out of the bathing pool and trotted up the beach and sat in the shade beneath the palms. His fair hair was plastered over his eyebrows and he pushed it back. Simon was floating in the water and kicking with his feet, and Maurice was practicing diving. Piggy was mooning about, aimlessly picking up things and discarding them. The rock-pools which so fascinated him were covered by the tide, so he was without an interest until the tide went back. Presently, seeing Ralph under the palms, he came and sat by him. Piggy wore the remainders of a pair of shorts, his fat body was golden brown, and the glasses still flashed when he looked at anything. He was the only boy on the island whose hair never seemed to grow. The rest were shockheaded, but Piggy's hair still lay in wisps over his head as though baldness were his natural state and this imperfect covering would soon go, like the velvet on a young stag's antlers. \"I've been thinking,\" he said, \"about a clock. We could make a sundial. We could put a stick in the sand, and then--\"\n","Processing asent: The effort to express the mathematical processes involved was too great. He made a few passes instead. \"And an airplane, and a TV set,\" said Ralph sourly, \"and a steam engine.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy shook his head. \"You have to have a lot of metal things for that,\" he said, \"and we haven't got no metal. But we got a stick.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned and smiled involuntarily. Piggy was a bore; his fat, his ass-mar and his matter-of-fact ideas were dull, but there was always a little pleasure to be got out of pulling his leg, even if one did it by accident. Piggy saw the smile and misinterpreted it as friendliness. There had grown up tacitly among the biguns the opinion that Piggy was an outsider, not only by accent, which did not matter, but by fat, and ass-mar, and specs, and a certain disinclination for manual labor. Now, finding that something he had said made Ralph smile, he rejoiced and pressed his advantage. \"We got a lot of sticks. We could have a sundial each. Then we should know what the time was.\" \"A fat lot of good that would be.\" \"You said you wanted things done. So as we could be rescued.\" \"Oh, shut up.\"\n","Processing asent: He leapt to his feet and trotted back to the pool, just as Maurice did a rather poor dive. Ralph was glad of a chance to change the subject. He shouted as Maurice came to the surface. \"Belly flop! Belly flop!\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice flashed a smile at Ralph who slid easily into the water. Of all the boys, he was the most at home there; but today, irked by the mention of rescue, the useless, footling mention of rescue, even the green depths of water and the shattered, golden sun held no balm. Instead of remaining and playing, he swam with steady strokes under Simon and crawled out of the other side of the pool to lie there, sleek and streaming like a seal. Piggy, always clumsy, stood up and came to stand by him, so that Ralph rolled on his stomach and pretended not to see. The mirages had died away and gloomily he ran his eye along the taut blue line of the horizon. The next moment he was on his feet and shouting. \"Smoke! Smoke!\"\n","Processing asent: Simon tried to sit up in the water and got a mouthful. Maurice, who had been standing ready to dive, swayed back on his heels, made a bolt for the platform, then swerved back to the grass under the palms. There he started to pull on his tattered shorts, to be ready for anything. Ralph stood, one hand holding back his hair, the other clenched. Simon was climbing out of the water. Piggy was rubbing his glasses on his shorts and squinting at the sea. Maurice had got both legs through one leg of his shorts. Of all the boys, only Ralph was still. \"I can't see no smoke,\" said Piggy incredulously. \"I can't see no smoke, Ralph--where is it?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph said nothing. Now both his hands were clenched over his forehead so that the fair hair was kept out of his eyes. He was leaning forward and already the salt was whitening his body. \"Ralph--where's the ship?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon stood by, looking from Ralph to the horizon. Maurice's trousers gave way with a sigh and he abandoned them as a wreck, rushed toward the forest, and then came back again. The smoke was a tight little knot on the horizon and was uncoiling slowly. Beneath the smoke was a dot that might be a funnel. Ralph's face was pale as he spoke to himself. \"They'll see our smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy was looking in the right direction now. \"It don't look much.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned round and peered up at the mountain. Ralph continued to watch the ship, ravenously. Color was coming back into his face. Simon stood by him, silent. \"I know I can't see very much,\" said Piggy, \"but have we got any smoke?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph moved impatiently, still watching the ship. \"The smoke on the mountain.\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice came running, and stared out to sea. Both Simon and Piggy were looking up at the mountain. Piggy screwed up his face but Simon cried out as though he had hurt himself. \"Ralph! Ralph!\"\n","Processing asent: The quality of his speech twisted Ralph on the sand. \"You tell me,\" said Piggy anxiously. \"Is there a signal?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked back at the dispersing smoke in the horizon, then up at the mountain. \"Ralph--please! Is there a signal?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon put out his hand, timidly, to touch Ralph; but Ralph started to run, splashing through the shallow end of the bathing pool, across the hot, white sand and under the palms. A moment later he was battling with the complex undergrowth that was already engulfing the scar. Simon ran after him, then Maurice. Piggy shouted. \"Ralph! Please--Ralph!\"\n","Processing asent: Then he too started to run, stumbling over Maurice's discarded shorts before he was across the terrace. Behind the four boys, the smoke moved gently along the horizon; and on the beach, Henry and Johnny were throwing sand at Percival who was crying quietly again; and all three were in complete ignorance of the excitement. By the time Ralph had reached the landward end of the scar he was using precious breath to swear. He did desperate violence to his naked body among the rasping creepers so that blood was sliding over him. Just where the steep ascent of the mountain began, he stopped. Maurice was only a few yards behind him. \"Piggy's specs!\" shouted Ralph. \"If the fire's all out, we'll need them--\"\n","Processing asent: He stopped shouting and swayed on his feet. Piggy was only just visible, bumbling up from the beach. Ralph looked at the horizon, then up to the mountain. Was it better to fetch Piggy's glasses, or would the ship have gone? Or if they climbed on, supposing the fire was all out, and they had to watch Piggy crawling nearer and the ship sinking under the horizon? Balanced on a high peak of need, agonized by indecision, Ralph cried out: \"Oh God, oh God!\"\n","Processing asent: Simon, struggling with the bushes, caught his breath. His face was twisted. Ralph blundered on, savaging himself, as the wisp of smoke moved on. The fire was dead. They saw that straight away; saw what they had really known down on the beach when the smoke of home had beckoned. The fire was out, smokeless and dead; the watchers were gone. A pile of unused fuel lay ready. Ralph turned to the sea. The horizon stretched, impersonal once more, barren of all but the faintest trace of smoke. Ralph ran stumbling along the rocks, saved himself on the edge of the pink cliff, and screamed at the ship. \"Come back! Come back!\"\n","Processing asent: He ran backwards and forwards along the cliff, his face always to the sea, and his voice rose insanely. \"Come back! Come back!\"\n","Processing asent: Simon and Maurice arrived. Ralph looked at them with unwinking eyes. Simon turned away, smearing the water from his cheeks. Ralph reached inside himself for the worst word he knew. \"They let the bloody fire go out.\"\n","Processing asent: He looked down the unfriendly side of the mountain. Piggy arrived, out of breath and whimpering like a littlun. Ralph clenched his fist and went very red. The intentness of his gaze, the bitterness of his voice, pointed for him. \"There they are.\"\n","Processing asent: A procession had appeared, far down among the pink stones that lay near the water's edge. Some of the boys wore black caps but otherwise they were almost naked. They lifted sticks in the air together whenever they came to an easy patch. They were chanting, something to do with the bundle that the errant twins carried so carefully. Ralph picked out Jack easily, even at that distance, tall, red-haired, and inevitably leading the procession. Simon looked now, from Ralph to Jack, as he had looked from Ralph to the horizon, and what he saw seemed to make him afraid. Ralph said nothing more, but waited while the procession came nearer. The chant was audible but at that distance still wordless. Behind Jack walked the twins, carrying a great stake on their shoulders. The gutted carcass of a pig swung from the stake, swinging heavily as the twins toiled over the uneven ground. The pig's head hung down with gaping neck and seemed to search for something on the ground. At last the words of the chant floated up to them, across the bowl of blackened wood and ashes. \"_Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood._\" Yet as the words became audible, the procession reached the steepest part of the mountain, and in a minute or two the chant had died away. Piggy sniveled and Simon shushed him quickly as though he had spoken too loudly in church. Jack, his face smeared with clays, reached the top first and hailed Ralph excitedly, with lifted spear. \"Look! We've killed a pig--we stole up on them--we got in a circle--\"\n","Processing asent: Voices broke in from the hunters. \"We got in a circle--\" \"We crept up--\" \"The pig squealed--\"\n","Processing asent: The twins stood with the pig swinging between them, dropping black gouts on the rock. They seemed to share one wide, ecstatic grin. Jack had too many things to tell Ralph at once. Instead, he danced a step or two, then remembered his dignity and stood still, grinning. He noticed blood on his hands and grimaced distastefully, looked for something on which to clean them, then wiped them on his shorts and laughed. Ralph spoke. \"You let the fire go out.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack checked, vaguely irritated by this irrelevance but too happy to let it worry him. \"We can light the fire again. You should have been with us, Ralph. We had a smashing time. The twins got knocked over--\" \"We hit the pig--\" \"--I fell on top--\" \"I cut the pig's throat,\" said Jack, proudly, and yet twitched as he said it. \"Can I borrow yours, Ralph, to make a nick in the hilt?\"\n","Processing asent: The boys chattered and danced. The twins continued to grin. \"There was lashings of blood,\" said Jack, laughing and shuddering, \"you should have seen it!\" \"We'll go hunting every day--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph spoke again, hoarsely. He had not moved. \"You let the fire go out.\"\n","Processing asent: This repetition made Jack uneasy. He looked at the twins and then back at Ralph. \"We had to have them in the hunt,\" he said, \"or there wouldn't have been enough for a ring.\"\n","Processing asent: He flushed, conscious of a fault. \"The fire's only been out an hour or two. We can light up again--\"\n","Processing asent: He noticed Ralph's scarred nakedness, and the sombre silence of all four of them. He sought, charitable in his happiness, to include them in the thing that had happened. His mind was crowded with memories; memories of the knowledge that had come to them when they closed in on the struggling pig, knowledge that they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will upon it, taken away its life like a long satisfying drink. He spread his arms wide. \"You should have seen the blood!\"\n","Processing asent: The hunters were more silent now, but at this they buzzed again. Ralph flung back his hair. One arm pointed at the empty horizon. His voice was loud and savage, and struck them into silence. \"There was aship.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack, faced at once with too many awful implications, ducked away from them. He laid a hand on the pig and drew his knife. Ralph brought his arm down, fist clenched, and his voice shook. \"There was a ship. Out there. You said you'd keep the fire going and you let it out!\"\n","Processing asent: He took a step toward Jack, who turned and faced him. \"They might have seen us. We might have gone home--\"\n","Processing asent: This was too bitter for Piggy, who forgot his timidity in the agony of his loss. He began to cry out, shrilly: \"You and your blood, Jack Merridew! You and your hunting! We might have gone home--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pushed Piggy to one side. \"I was chief, and you were going to do what I said. You talk. But you can't even build huts--then you go off hunting and let out the fire--\"\n","Processing asent: He turned away, silent for a moment. Then his voice came again on a peak of feeling. \"There was a ship--\"\n","Processing asent: One of the smaller hunters began to wail. The dismal truth was filtering through to everybody. Jack went very red as he hacked and pulled at the pig. \"The job was too much. We needed everyone.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned. \"You could have had everyone when the shelters were finished. But you had to hunt--\" \"We needed meat.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack stood up as he said this, the bloodied knife in his hand. The two boys faced each other. There was the brilliant world of hunting, tactics, fierce exhilaration, skill; and there was the world of longing and baffled commonsense. Jack transferred the knife to his left hand and smudged blood over his forehead as he pushed down the plastered hair. Piggy began again. \"You didn't ought to have let that fire out. You said you'd keep the smoke going--\"\n","Processing asent: This from Piggy, and the wails of agreement from some of the hunters, drove Jack to violence. The bolting look came into his blue eyes. He took a step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy's stomach. Piggy sat down with a grunt. Jack stood over him. His voice was vicious with humiliation. \"You would, would you? Fatty!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph made a step forward and Jack smacked Piggy's head. Piggy's glasses flew off and tinkled on the rocks. Piggy cried out in terror: \"My specs!\"\n","Processing asent: He went crouching and feeling over the rocks but Simon, who got there first, found them for him. Passions beat about Simon on the mountain-top with awful wings. \"One side's broken.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy grabbed and put on the glasses. He looked malevolently at Jack. \"I got to have them specs. Now I only got one eye. Jus' you wait--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack made a move toward Piggy who scrambled away till a great rock lay between them. He thrust his head over the top and glared at Jack through his one flashing glass. \"Now I only got one eye. Just you wait--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack mimicked the whine and scramble. \"Jus' you wait--yah!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy and the parody were so funny that the hunters began to laugh. Jack felt encouraged. He went on scrambling and the laughter rose to a gale of hysteria. Unwillingly Ralph felt his lips twitch; he was angry with himself for giving way. He muttered. \"That was a dirty trick.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack broke out of his gyration and stood facing Ralph. His words came in a shout. \"All right, all right!\"\n","Processing asent: He looked at Piggy, at the hunters, at Ralph. \"I'm sorry. About the fire, I mean. There. I--\"\n","Processing asent: He drew himself up. \"--I apologize.\n","Processing asent: \" The buzz from the hunters was one of admiration at this handsome behavior. Clearly they were of the opinion that Jack had done the decent thing, had put himself in the right by his generous apology and Ralph, obscurely, in the wrong. They waited for an appropriately decent answer. Yet Ralph's throat refused to pass one. He resented, as an addition to Jack's misbehavior, this verbal trick. The fire was dead, the ship was gone. Could they not see? Anger instead of decency passed his throat. \"That was a dirty trick.\n","Processing asent: \" They were silent on the mountain-top while the opaque look appeared in Jack's eyes and passed away. Ralph's final word was an ingracious mutter. \"All right.\n","Processing asent: Light the fire.\n","Processing asent: \" With some positive action before them, a little of the tension died. Ralph said no more, did nothing, stood looking down at the ashes round his feet. Jack was loud and active. He gave orders, sang, whistled, threw remarks at the silent Ralph--remarks that did not need an answer, and therefore could not invite a snub; and still Ralph was silent. No one, not even Jack, would ask him to move and in the end they had to build the fire three yards away and in a place not really as convenient. So Ralph asserted his chieftainship and could not have chosen a better way if he had thought for days. Against this weapon, so indefinable and so effective, Jack was powerless and raged without knowing why. By the time the pile was built, they were on different sides of a high barrier. When they had dealt with the fire another crisis arose. Jack had no means of lighting it. Then to his surprise, Ralph went to Piggy and took the glasses from him. Not even Ralph knew how a link between him and Jack had been snapped and fastened elsewhere. \"I'll bring 'em back.\" \"I'll come too.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy stood behind him, islanded in a sea of meaningless color, while Ralph knelt and focused the glossy spot. Instantly the fire was alight, Piggy held out his hands and grabbed the glasses back. Before these fantastically attractive flowers of violet and red and yellow, unkindness melted away. They became a circle of boys round a camp fire and even Piggy and Ralph were half-drawn in. Soon some of the boys were rushing down the slope for more wood while Jack hacked the pig. They tried holding the whole carcass on a stake over the fire, but the stake burnt more quickly than the pig roasted. In the end they skewered bits of meat on branches and held them in the flames: and even then almost as much boy was roasted as meat. Ralph's mouth watered. He meant to refuse meat, but his past diet of fruit and nuts, with an odd crab or fish, gave him too little resistance. He accepted a piece of halfraw meat and gnawed it like a wolf. Piggy spoke, also dribbling. \"Aren't I having none?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack had meant to leave him in doubt, as an assertion of power; but Piggy by advertising his omission made more cruelty necessary. \"You didn't hunt.\" \"No more did Ralph,\" said Piggy wetly, \"nor Simon.\"\n","Processing asent: He amplified. \"There isn't more than a ha'porth of meat in a crab.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph stirred uneasily. Simon, sitting between the twins and Piggy, wiped his mouth and shoved his piece of meat over the rocks to Piggy, who grabbed it. The twins giggled and Simon lowered his face in shame. Then Jack leapt to his feet, slashed off a great hunk of meat, and flung it down at Simon's feet. \"Eat! Damn you!\"\n","Processing asent: He glared at Simon. \"Take it!\"\n","Processing asent: He spun on his heel, center of a bewildered circle of boys. \"I got you meat!\"\n","Processing asent: Numberless and inexpressible frustrations combined to make his rage elemental and awe-inspiring. \"I painted my face--I stole up. Now you eat--all of you--and I--\"\n","Processing asent: Slowly the silence on the mountain-top deepened till the click of the fire and the soft hiss of roasting meat could be heard clearly. Jack looked round for understanding but found only respect. Ralph stood among the ashes of the signal fire, his hands full of meat, saying nothing. Then at last Maurice broke the silence. He changed the subject to the only one that could bring the majority of them together. \"Where did you find the pig?\"\n","Processing asent: Roger pointed down the unfriendly side. \"They were there--by the sea.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack, recovering could not bear to have his story told. He broke in quickly. \"We spread round. I crept, on hands and knees. The spears fell out because they hadn't barbs on. The pig ran away and made an awful noise--\" \"It turned back and ran into the circle, bleeding--\"\n","Processing asent: All the boys were talking at once, relieved and excited. \"We closed in--\"\n","Processing asent: The first blow had paralyzed its hind quarters, so then the circle could close in and beat and beat-- \"I cut the pig's throat--\"\n","Processing asent: The twins, still sharing their identical grin, jumped up and ran round each other. Then the rest joined in, making pig-dying noises and shouting. \"One for his nob!\" \"Give him a fourpenny one!\"\n","Processing asent: Then Maurice pretended to be the pig and ran squealing into the center, and the hunters, circling still, pretended to beat him. As they danced, they sang. \"_Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in._\" Ralph watched them, envious and resentful. Not till they flagged and the chant died away, did he speak. \"I'm calling an assembly.\"\n","Processing asent: One by one, they halted, and stood watching him. \"With the conch. I'm calling a meeting even if we have to go on into the dark. Down on the platform. When I blow it. Now.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned away and walked off, down the mountain. CHAPTER FIVE  Beast from Water The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace. Ralph chose the firm strip as a path because he needed to think, and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them. Suddenly, pacing by the water, he was overcome with astonishment. He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one's waking life was spent watching one's feet. He stopped, facing the strip; and remembering that first enthusiastic exploration as though it were part of a brighter childhood, he smiled jeeringly. He turned then and walked back toward the platform with the sun in his face. The time had come for the assembly and as he walked into the concealing splendors of the sunlight he went carefully over the points of his speech. There must be no mistake about this assembly, no chasing imaginary. . . . He lost himself in a maze of thoughts that were rendered vague by his lack of words to express them. Frowning, he tried again. This meeting must not be fun, but business. At that he walked faster, aware all at once of urgency and the declining sun and a little wind created by his speed that breathed about his face. This wind pressed his grey shirt against his chest so that he noticed--in this new mood of comprehension--how the folds were stiff like cardboard, and unpleasant; noticed too how the frayed edges of his shorts were making an uncomfortable, pink area on the front of his thighs. With a convulsion of the mind, Ralph discovered dirt and decay, understood how much he disliked perpetually flicking the tangled hair out of his eyes, and at last, when the sun was gone, rolling noisily to rest among dry leaves. At that he began to trot. The beach near the bathing pool was dotted with groups of boys waiting for the assembly. They made way for him silently, conscious of his grim mood and the fault at the fire. The place of assembly in which he stood was roughly a triangle; but irregular and sketchy, like everything they made. First there was the log on which he himself sat; a dead tree that must have been quite exceptionally big for the platform. Perhaps one of those legendary storms of the Pacific had shifted it here. This palm trunk lay parallel to the beach, so that when Ralph sat he faced the island but to the boys was a darkish figure against the shimmer of the lagoon. The two sides of the triangle of which the log was base were less evenly defined. On the right was a log polished by restless seats along the top, but not so large as the chief's and not so comfortable. On the left were four small logs, one of them--the farthest-- lamentably springy. Assembly after assembly had broken up in laughter when someone had leaned too far back and the log had whipped and thrown half a dozen boys backwards into the grass. Yet now, he saw, no one had had the wit--not himself nor Jack, nor Piggy--to bring a stone and wedge the thing. So they would continue enduring the ill-balanced twister, because, because. . . . Again he lost himself in deep waters. Grass was worn away in front of each trunk but grew tall and untrodden in the center of the triangle. Then, at the apex, the grass was thick again because no one sat there. All round the place of assembly the grey trunks rose, straight or leaning, and supported the low roof of leaves. On two sides was the beach; behind, the lagoon; in front, the darkness of the island. Ralph turned to the chief's seat. They had never had an assembly as late before. That was why the place looked so different. Normally the underside of the green roof was lit by a tangle of golden reflections, and their faces were lit upside down--like, thought Ralph, when you hold an electric torch in your hands. But now the sun was slanting in at one side, so that the shadows were where they ought to be. Again he fell into that strange mood of speculation that was so foreign to him. If faces were different when lit from above or below--what was a face? What was anything? Ralph moved impatiently. The trouble was, if you were a chief you had to think, you had to be wise. And then the occasion slipped by so that you had to grab at a decision. This made you think; because thought was a valuable thing, that got results. . . . Only, decided Ralph as he faced the chief's seat, I can't think. Not like Piggy. Once more that evening Ralph had to adjust his values. Piggy could think. He could go step by step inside that fat head of his, only Piggy was no chief. But Piggy, for all his ludicrous body, had brains. Ralph was a specialist in thought now, and could recognize thought in another. The sun in his eyes reminded him how time was passing, so he took the conch down from the tree and examined the surface. Exposure to the air had bleached the yellow and pink to near-white, and transparency. Ralph felt a kind of affectionate reverence for the conch, even though he had fished the thing out of the lagoon himself. He faced the place of assembly and put the conch to his lips. The others were waiting for this and came straight away. Those who were aware that a ship had passed the island while the fire was out were subdued by the thought of Ralph's anger; while those, including the littluns who did not know, were impressed by the general air of solemnity. The place of assembly filled quickly; Jack, Simon, Maurice, most of the hunters, on Ralph's right; the rest on the left, under the sun. Piggy came and stood outside the triangle. This indicated that he wished to listen, but would not speak; and Piggy intended it as a gesture of disapproval. \"The thing is: we need an assembly.\"\n","Processing asent: No one said anything but the faces turned to Ralph were intent. He flourished the conch. He had learnt as a practical business that fundamental statements like this had to be said at least twice, before everyone understood them. One had to sit, attracting all eyes to the conch, and drop words like heavy round stones among the little groups that crouched or squatted. He was searching his mind for simple words so that even the littluns would understand what the assembly was about. Later perhaps, practiced debaters--Jack, Maurice, Piggy--would use their whole art to twist the meeting: but now at the beginning the subject of the debate must be laid out clearly. \"We need an assembly. Not for fun. Not for laughing and falling off the log\"--the group of littluns on the twister giggled and looked at each other--\"not for making jokes, or for\"--he lifted the conch in an effort to find the compelling word--\"for cleverness. Not for these things. But to put things straight.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for a moment. \"I've been alone. By myself I went, thinking what's what. I know what we need. An assembly to put things straight. And first of all, I'm speaking.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for a moment and automatically pushed back his hair. Piggy tiptoed to the triangle, his ineffectual protest made, and joined the others. Ralph went on. \"We have lots of assemblies. Everybody enjoys speaking and being together. We decide things. But they don't get done. We were going to have water brought from the stream and left in those coconut shells under fresh leaves. So it was, for a few days. Now there's no water. The shells are dry. People drink from the river.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a murmur of assent. \"Not that there's anything wrong with drinking from the river. I mean I'd sooner have water from that place-- you know, the pool where the waterfall is--than out of an old coconut shell. Only we said we'd have the water brought. And now not. There were only two full shells there this afternoon.\"\n","Processing asent: He licked his lips. \"Then there's huts. Shelters.\"\n","Processing asent: The murmur swelled again and died away. \"You mostly sleep in shelters. Tonight, except for Samneric up by the fire, you'll all sleep there. Who built the shelters?\"\n","Processing asent: Clamor rose at once. Everyone had built the shelters. Ralph had to wave the conch once more. \"Wait a minute! I mean, who built all three? We all built the first one, four of us the second one, and me 'n Simon built the last one over there. That's why it's so tottery. No. Don't laugh. That shelter might fall down if the rain comes back. We'll need those shelters then.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused and cleared his throat. \"There's another thing. We chose those rocks right along beyond the bathing pool as a lavatory. That was sensible too. The tide cleans the place up. You littluns know about that.\"\n","Processing asent: There were sniggers here and there and swift glances. \"Now people seem to use anywhere. Even near the shelters and the platform. You littluns, when you're getting fruit; if you're taken short--\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly roared. \"I said if you're taken short you keep away from the fruit. That's dirty!\"\n","Processing asent: Laughter rose again. \"I said that's dirty!\"\n","Processing asent: He plucked at his stiff, grey shirt. \"That's really dirty. If you're taken short you go right along the beach to the rocks. See?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy held out his hands for the conch but Ralph shook his head. His speech was planned, point by point. \"We've all got to use the rocks again. This place is getting dirty.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused. The assembly, sensing a crisis, was tensely expectant. \"And then: about the fire.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph let out his spare breath with a little gasp that was echoed by his audience. Jack started to chip a piece of wood with his knife and whispered something to Robert, who looked away. \"The fire is the most important thing on the island. How can we ever be rescued except by luck, if we don't keep a fire going? Is a fire too much for us to make?\"\n","Processing asent: He flung out an arm. \"Look at us! How many are we? And yet we can't keep a fire going to make smoke. Don't you understand? Can't you see we ought to--ought to die before we let the fire out?\"\n","Processing asent: There was a self-conscious giggling among the hunters. Ralph turned on them passionately. \"You hunters! You can laugh! But I tell you the smoke is more important than the pig, however often you kill one. Do all of you see?\"\n","Processing asent: He spread his arms wide and turned to the whole triangle. \"We've got to make smoke up there--or die.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused, feeling for his next point. \"And another thing.\"\n","Processing asent: Someone called out. \"Too many things.\"\n","Processing asent: There came a mutter of agreement. Ralph overrode them. \"And another thing. We nearly set the whole island on fire. And we waste time, rolling rocks, and making little cooking fires. Now I say this and make it a rule, because I'm chief. We won't have a fire anywhere but on the mountain. Ever.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a row immediately. Boys stood up and shouted and Ralph shouted back. \"Because if you want a fire to cook fish or crab, you can jolly well go up the mountain. That way we'll be certain.\"\n","Processing asent: Hands were reaching for the conch in the light of the setting sun. He held on and leapt on the trunk. \"All this I meant to say. Now I've said it. You voted me for chief. Now you do what I say.\"\n","Processing asent: They quieted, slowly, and at last were seated again. Ralph dropped down and spoke in his ordinary voice. \"So remember. The rocks for a lavatory. Keep the fire going and smoke showing as a signal. Don't take fire from the mountain. Take your food up there.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack stood up, scowling in the gloom, and held out his hands. \"I haven't finished yet.\" \"But you've talked and talked!\" \"I've got the conch.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack sat down, grumbling. \"Then the last thing. This is what people can talk about.\"\n","Processing asent: He waited till the platform was very still. \"Things are breaking up. I don't understand why. We began well; we were happy. And then--\"\n","Processing asent: He moved the conch gently, looking beyond them at nothing, remembering the beastie, the snake, the fire, the talk of fear. \"Then people started getting frightened.\"\n","Processing asent: A murmur, almost a moan, rose and passed away. Jack had stopped whittling. Ralph went on, abruptly. \"But that's littluns' talk.\n","Processing asent: We'll get that straight.\n","Processing asent: So the last part, the bit we can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear.\n","Processing asent: \" The hair was creeping into his eyes again. \"We've got to talk about this fear and decide there's nothing in it.\n","Processing asent: I'm frightened myself, sometimes; only that's nonsense!\n","Processing asent: Like bogies.\n","Processing asent: Then, when we've decided, we can start again and be careful about things like the fire.\n","Processing asent: \" A picture of three boys walking along the bright beach flitted through his mind. \"And be happy.\n","Processing asent: \" Ceremonially, Ralph laid the conch on the trunk beside him as a sign that the speech was over. What sunlight reached them was level. Jack stood up and took the conch. \"So this is a meeting to find out what's what.\n","Processing asent: I'll tell you what's what.\n","Processing asent: You littluns started all this, with the fear talk.\n","Processing asent: Beasts!\n","Processing asent: Where from?\n","Processing asent: Of course we're frightened sometimes but we put up with being frightened.\n","Processing asent: Only Ralph says you scream in the night.\n","Processing asent: What does that mean but nightmares?\n","Processing asent: Anyway, you don't hunt or build or help--you're a lot of cry-babies and sissies.\n","Processing asent: That's what.\n","Processing asent: And as for the fear--you'll have to put up with that like the rest of us.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph looked at Jack open-mouthed, but Jack took no notice. \"The thing is--fear can't hurt you any more than a dream.\n","Processing asent: There aren't any beasts to be afraid of on this island.\n","Processing asent: \" He looked along the row of whispering littluns. \"Serve you right if something did get you, you useless lot of cry-babies!\n","Processing asent: But there is no animal--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph interrupted him testily. \"What is all this? Who said anything about an animal?\" \"You did, the other day. You said they dream and cry out. Now they talk--not only the littluns, but my hunters sometimes--talk of a thing, a dark thing, a beast, some sort of animal. I've heard. You thought not, didn't you? Now listen. You don't get big animals on small islands. Only pigs. You only get lions and tigers in big countries like Africa and India--\" \"And the Zoo--\" \"I've got the conch. I'm not talking about the fear. I'm talking about the beast. Be frightened if you like. But as for the beast--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack paused, cradling the conch, and turned to his hunters with their dirty black caps. \"Am I a hunter or am I not?\"\n","Processing asent: They nodded, simply. He was a hunter all right. No one doubted that. \"Well then--I've been all over this island. By myself. If there were a beast I'd have seen it. Be frightened because you're like that--but there is no beast in the forest.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack handed back the conch and sat down. The whole assembly applauded him with relief. Then Piggy held out his hand. \"I don't agree with all Jack said, but with some.\n","Processing asent: 'Course there isn't a beast in the forest. How could there be? What would a beast eat?\" \"Pig.\" \"We eat pig.\" \"Piggy!\" \"I got the conch!\" said Piggy indignantly. \"Ralph-- they ought to shut up, oughtn't they? You shut up, you littluns! What I mean is that I don't agree about this here fear. Of course there isn't nothing to be afraid of in the forest. Why--I been there myself! You'll be talking about ghosts and such things next. We know what goes on and if there's something wrong, there's someone to put it right.\"\n","Processing asent: He took off his glasses and blinked at them. The sun had gone as if the light had been turned off. He proceeded to explain. \"If you get a pain in your stomach, whether it's a little one or a big one--\" \"Yours is a big one.\" \"When you done laughing perhaps we can get on with the meeting. And if them littluns climb back on the twister again they'll only fall off in a sec. So they might as well sit on the ground and listen. No. You have doctors for everything, even the inside of your mind. You don't really mean that we got to be frightened all the time of nothing? Life,\" said Piggy expansively, \"is scientific, that's what it is. In a year or two when the war's over they'll be traveling to Mars and back. I know there isn't no beast--not with claws and all that, I mean-- but I know there isn't no fear, either.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy paused. \"Unless--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph moved restlessly. \"Unless what?\" \"Unless we get frightened of people.\"\n","Processing asent: A sound, half-laugh, half-jeer, rose among the seated boys. Piggy ducked his head and went on hastily. \"So let's hear from that littlun who talked about a beast and perhaps we can show him how silly he is.\"\n","Processing asent: The littluns began to jabber among themselves, then one stood forward. \"What's your name?\" \"Phil.\"\n","Processing asent: For a littlun he was self-confident, holding out his hands, cradling the conch as Ralph did, looking round at them to collect their attention before he spoke. \"Last night I had a dream, a horrid dream, fighting with things. I was outside the shelter by myself, fighting with things, those twisty things in the trees.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused, and the other littluns laughed in horrified sympathy. \"Then I was frightened and I woke up. And I was outside the shelter by myself in the dark and the twisty things had gone away.\"\n","Processing asent: The vivid horror of this, so possible and so nakedly terrifying, held them all silent. The child's voice went piping on from behind the white conch. \"And I was frightened and started to call out for Ralph and then I saw something moving among the trees, something big and horrid.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused, half-frightened by the recollection yet proud of the sensation he was creating. \"That was a nightmare,\" said Ralph. \"He was walking in his sleep.\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly murmured in subdued agreement. The littlun shook his head stubbornly. \"I was asleep when the twisty things were fighting and when they went away I was awake, and I saw something big and horrid moving in the trees.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph held out his hands for the conch and the littlun sat down. \"You were asleep. There wasn't anyone there. How could anyone be wandering about in the forest at night? Was anyone? Did anyone go out?\"\n","Processing asent: There was a long pause while the assembly grinned at the thought of anyone going out in the darkness. Then Simon stood up and Ralph looked at him in astonishment. \"You! What were you mucking about in the dark for?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon grabbed the conch convulsively. \"I wanted--to go to a place--a place I know.\" \"What place?\" \"Just a place I know. A place in the jungle.\"\n","Processing asent: He hesitated. Jack settled the question for them with that contempt in his voice that could sound so funny and so final. \"He was taken short.\"\n","Processing asent: With a feeling of humiliation on Simon's behalf, Ralph took back the conch, looking Simon sternly in the face as he did so. \"Well, don't do it again. Understand? Not at night. There's enough silly talk about beasts, without the littluns seeing you gliding about like a--\"\n","Processing asent: The derisive laughter that rose had fear in it and condemnation. Simon opened his mouth to speak but Ralph had the conch, so he backed to his seat. When the assembly was silent Ralph turned to Piggy. \"Well, Piggy?\" \"There was another one. Him.\"\n","Processing asent: The littluns pushed Percival forward, then left him by himself. He stood knee-deep in the central grass, looking at his hidden feet, trying to pretend he was in a tent. Ralph remembered another small boy who had stood like this and he flinched away from the memory. He had pushed the thought down and out of sight, where only some positive reminder like this could bring it to the surface. There had been no further numberings of the littluns, partly because there was no means of insuring that all of them were accounted for and partly because Ralph knew the answer to at least one question Piggy had asked on the mountaintop. There were little boys, fair, dark, freckled, and all dirty, but their faces were all dreadfully free of major blemishes. No one had seen the mulberry-colored birthmark again. But that time Piggy had coaxed and bullied. Tacitly admitting that he remembered the unmentionable, Ralph nodded to Piggy. \"Go on. Ask him.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy knelt, holding the conch. \"Now then. What's your name?\"\n","Processing asent: The small boy twisted away into his tent. Piggy turned helplessly to Ralph, who spoke sharply. \"What's your name?\"\n","Processing asent: Tormented by the silence and the refusal the assembly broke into a chant. \"What's your name? What's your name?\" \"Quiet!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph peered at the child in the twilight. \"Now tell us. What's your name?\" \"Percival Wemys Madison. The Vicarage, Harcourt St. Anthony, Hants, telephone, telephone, tele--\"\n","Processing asent: As if this information was rooted far down in the springs of sorrow, the littlun wept. His face puckered, the tears leapt from his eyes, his mouth opened till they could see a square black hole. At first he was a silent effigy of sorrow; but then the lamentation rose out of him, loud and sustained as the conch. \"Shut up, you! Shut up!\"\n","Processing asent: Percival Wemys Madison would not shut up. A spring had been tapped, far beyond the reach of authority or even physical intimidation. The crying went on, breath after breath, and seemed to sustain him upright as if he were nailed to it. \"Shut up! Shut up!\"\n","Processing asent: For now the littluns were no longer silent. They were reminded of their personal sorrows; and perhaps felt themselves to share in a sorrow that was universal. They began to cry in sympathy, two of them almost as loud as Percival. Maurice saved them. He cried out. \"Look at me!\"\n","Processing asent: He pretended to fall over. He rubbed his rump and sat on the twister so that he fell in the grass. He downed badly; but Percival and the others noticed and sniffed and laughed. Presently they were all laughing so absurdly that the biguns joined in. Jack was the first to make himself heard. He had not got the conch and thus spoke against the rules; but nobody minded. \"And what about the beast?\"\n","Processing asent: Something strange was happening to Percival. He yawned and staggered, so that Jack seized and shook him. \"Where does the beast live?\"\n","Processing asent: Percival sagged in Jack's grip. \"That's a clever beast,\" said Piggy, jeering, \"if it can hide on this island.\" \"Jack's been everywhere--\" \"Where could a beast live?\" \"Beast my foot!\"\n","Processing asent: Percival muttered something and the assembly laughed again. Ralph leaned forward. \"What does he say?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack listened to Percival's answer and then let go of him. Percival, released, surrounded by the comfortable presence of humans, fell in the long grass and went to sleep. Jack cleared his throat, then reported casually. \"He says the beast comes out of the sea.\"\n","Processing asent: The last laugh died away. Ralph turned involuntarily, a black, humped figure against the lagoon. The assembly looked with him, considered the vast stretches of water, the high sea beyond, unknown indigo of infinite possibility, heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef. Maurice spoke, so loudly that they jumped. \"Daddy said they haven't found all the animals in the sea yet.\"\n","Processing asent: Argument started again. Ralph held out the glimmering conch and Maurice took it obediently. The meeting subsided. \"I mean when Jack says you can be frightened because people are frightened anyway that's all right. But when he says there's only pigs on this island I expect he's right but he doesn't know, not really, not certainly I mean--\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice took a breath. \"My daddy says there's things, what d'you call'em that make ink--squids--that are hundreds of yards long and eat whales whole.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused again and laughed gaily. \"I don't believe in the beast of course. As Piggy says, life's scientific, but we don't know, do we? Not certainly, I mean--\"\n","Processing asent: Someone shouted. \"A squid couldn't come up out of the water!\" \"Could!\" \"Couldn't!\"\n","Processing asent: In a moment the platform was full of arguing, gesticulating shadows. To Ralph, seated, this seemed the breaking up of sanity. Fear, beasts, no general agreement that the fire was allimportant: and when one tried to get the thing straight the argument sheered off, bringing up fresh, unpleasant matter. He could see a whiteness in the gloom near him so he grabbed it from Maurice and blew as loudly as he could. The assembly was shocked into silence. Simon was close to him, laying hands on the conch. Simon felt a perilous necessity to speak; but to speak in assembly was a terrible thing to him. \"Maybe,\" he said hesitantly, \"maybe there is a beast.\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly cried out savagely and Ralph stood up in amazement. \"You, Simon? You believe in this?\" \"I don't know,\" said Simon. His heartbeats were choking him. \"But. . . .\"\n","Processing asent: The storm broke. \"Sit down!\" \"Shut up!\" \"Take the conch!\" \"Sod you!\" \"Shut up!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shouted. \"Hear him! He's got the conch!\" \"What I mean is . . . maybe it's only us.\" \"Nuts!\"\n","Processing asent: That was from Piggy, shocked out of decorum. Simon went on. \"We could be sort of. . . .\"\n","Processing asent: Simon became inarticulate in his effort to express mankind's essential illness. Inspiration came to him. \"What's the dirtiest thing there is?\"\n","Processing asent: As an answer Jack dropped into the uncomprehending silence that followed it the one crude expressive syllable. Release was immense. Those littluns who had climbed back on the twister fell off again and did not mind. The hunters were screaming with delight. Simon's effort fell about him in ruins; the laughter beat him cruelly and he shrank away defenseless to his seat. At last the assembly was silent again. Someone spoke out of turn. \"Maybe he means it's some sort of ghost.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph lifted the conch and peered into the gloom. The lightest thing was the pale beach. Surely the littluns were nearer? Yes--there was no doubt about it, they were huddled into a tight knot of bodies in the central grass. A flurry of wind made the palms talk and the noise seemed very loud now that darkness and silence made it so noticeable. Two grey trunks rubbed each other with an evil speaking that no one had noticed by day. Piggy took the conch out of his hands. His voice was indignant. \"I don't believe in no ghosts--ever!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack was up too, unaccountably angry. \"Who cares what you believe--Fatty!\" \"I got the conch!\"\n","Processing asent: There was the sound of a brief tussle and the conch moved to and fro. \"You gimme the conch back!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pushed between them and got a thump on the chest. He wrestled the conch from someone and sat down breathlessly. \"There's too much talk about ghosts. We ought to have left all this for daylight.\"\n","Processing asent: A hushed and anonymous voice broke in. \"Perhaps that's what the beast is--a ghost.\"\n","Processing asent: The assembly was shaken as by a wind. \"There's too much talking out of turn,\" Ralph said, \"because we can't have proper assemblies if you don't stick to the rules.\"\n","Processing asent: He stopped again. The careful plan of this assembly had broken down. \"What d'you want me to say then? I was wrong to call this assembly so late. We'll have a vote on them; on ghosts I mean; and then go to the shelters because we're all tired. No--Jack is it?--wait a minute. I'll say here and now that I don't believe in ghosts. Or I don't think I do. But I don't like the thought of them. Not now that is, in the dark. But we were going to decide what's what.\"\n","Processing asent: He raised the conch for a moment. \"Very well then. I suppose what's what is whether there are ghosts or not--\"\n","Processing asent: He thought for a moment, formulating the question. \"Who thinks there may be ghosts?\"\n","Processing asent: For a long time there was silence and no apparent movement. Then Ralph peered into the gloom and made out the hands. He spoke flatly. \"I see.\"\n","Processing asent: The world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away. Once there was this and that; and now-- and the ship had gone. The conch was snatched from his hands and Piggy's voice shrilled. \"I didn't vote for no ghosts!\"\n","Processing asent: He whirled round on the assembly. \"Remember that, all of you!\"\n","Processing asent: They heard him stamp. \"What are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages? What's grownups going to think? Going off--hunting pigs--letting fires out--and now!\"\n","Processing asent: A shadow fronted him tempestuously. \"You shut up, you fat slug!\"\n","Processing asent: There was a moment's struggle and the glimmering conch jigged up and down. Ralph leapt to his feet. \"Jack! Jack! You haven't got the conch! Let him speak.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack's face swam near him. \"And you shut up! Who are you, anyway? Sitting there telling people what to do. You can't hunt, you can't sing--\" \"I'm chief. I was chosen.\" \"Why should choosing make any difference? Just giving orders that don't make any sense--\" \"Piggy's got the conch.\" \"That's right--favor Piggy as you always do--\" \"Jack!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack's voice sounded in bitter mimicry. \"Jack! Jack!\" \"The rules!\" shouted Ralph. \"You're breaking the rules!\" \"Who cares?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph summoned his wits. \"Because the rules are the only thing we've got!\"\n","Processing asent: But Jack was shouting against him. \"Bollocks to the rules! We're strong--we hunt! If there's a beast, we'll hunt it down! We'll close in and beat and beat and beat--!\"\n","Processing asent: He gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand. At once the platform was full of noise and excitement, scramblings, screams and laughter. The assembly shredded away and became a discursive and random scatter from the palms to the water and away along the beach, beyond night-sight. Ralph found his cheek touching the conch and took it from Piggy. \"What's grownups going to say?\" cried Piggy again. \"Look at 'em!\"\n","Processing asent: The sound of mock hunting, hysterical laughter and real terror came from the beach. \"Blow the conch, Ralph.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy was so close that Ralph could see the glint of his one glass. \"There's the fire. Can't they see?\" \"You got to be tough now. Make 'em do what you want.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph answered in the cautious voice of one who rehearses a theorem. \"If I blow the conch and they don't come back; then we've had it. We shan't keep the fire going. We'll be like animals. We'll never be rescued.\" \"If you don't blow, we'll soon be animals anyway. I can't see what they're doing but I can hear.\"\n","Processing asent: The dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense black mass that revolved. They were chanting something and littluns that had had enough were staggering away, howling. Ralph raised the conch to his lips and then lowered it. \"The trouble is: Are there ghosts, Piggy? Or beasts?\" \"Course there aren't.\" \"Why not?\" \"'Cos things wouldn't make sense. Houses an' streets, an'--TV--they wouldn't work.\n","Processing asent: \" The dancing, chanting boys had worked themselves away till their sound was nothing but a wordless rhythm. \"But s'pose they don't make sense?\n","Processing asent: Not here, on this island?\n","Processing asent: Supposing things are watching us and waiting?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shuddered violently and moved closer to Piggy, so that they bumped frighteningly. \"You stop talking like that!\n","Processing asent: We got enough trouble, Ralph, an' I've had as much as I can stand.\n","Processing asent: If there is ghosts--'' \"I ought to give up being chief. Hear 'em.\" \"Oh lord! Oh no!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy gripped Ralph's arm. \"If Jack was chief he'd have all hunting and no fire. We'd be here till we died.\"\n","Processing asent: His voice ran up to a squeak. \"Who's that sitting there?\" \"Me. Simon.\" \"Fat lot of good we are,\" said Ralph. \"Three blind mice. I'll give up.\" \"If you give up,\" said Piggy, in an appalled whisper, \"what 'ud happen to me?\" \"Nothing.\" \"He hates me. I dunno why. If he could do what he wanted--you're all right, he respects you. Besides--you'd hit him.\" \"You were having a nice fight with him just now.\" \"I had the conch,\" said Piggy simply. \"I had a right to speak.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon stirred in the dark. \"Go on being chief.\" \"You shut up, young Simon! Why couldn't you say there wasn't a beast?\" \"I'm scared of him,\" said Piggy, \"and that's why I know him. If you're scared of someone you hate him but you can't stop thinking about him. You kid yourself he's all right really, an' then when you see him again; it's like asthma an' you can't breathe. I tell you what. He hates you too, Ralph--\" \"Me? Why me?\" \"I dunno. You got him over the fire; an' you're chief an' he isn't.\" \"But he's, he's, Jack Merridew!\" \"I been in bed so much I done some thinking. I know about people. I know about me. And him. He can't hurt you: but if you stand out of the way he'd hurt the next thing. And that's me.\" \"Piggy's right, Ralph. There's you and Jack. Go on being chief.\" \"We're all drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grownup. Please, sir, please, miss; and then you got an answer. How I wish!\" \"I wish my auntie was here.\" \"I wish my father. . . Oh, what's the use?\" \"Keep the fire going.\"\n","Processing asent: The dance was over and the hunters were going back to the shelters.\n","Processing asent: \"Grownups know things,\" said Piggy.\n","Processing asent: \"They ain't afraid of the dark. They'd meet and have tea and discuss. Then things 'ud be all right--\" \"They wouldn't set fire to the island. Or lose--\" \"They'd build a ship--\"\n","Processing asent: The three boys stood in the darkness, striving unsuccessfully to convey the majesty of adult life. \"They wouldn't quarrel--\" \"Or break my specs--\" \"Or talk about a beast--\" \"If only they could get a message to us,\" cried Ralph desperately. \"If only they could send us something grownup. . . a sign or something.\"\n","Processing asent: A thin wail out of the darkness chilled them and set them grabbing for each other. Then the wail rose, remote and unearthly,' and turned to an inarticulate gibbering.\n","Processing asent: Percival Wemys Madison, of the Vicarage, Harcourt St. Anthony, lying in the long grass, was living through circumstances in which the incantation of his address was powerless to help him.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER SIX  Beast from Air There was no light left save that of the stars.\n","Processing asent: When they had understood what made this ghostly noise and Percival was quiet again, Ralph and Simon picked him up unhandily and carried him to a shelter.\n","Processing asent: Piggy hung about near for all his brave words, and the three bigger boys went together to the next shelter.\n","Processing asent: They lay restlessly and noisily among the dry leaves, watching the patch of stars that was the opening toward the lagoon.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes a littlun cried out from the other shelters and once a bigun spoke in the dark.\n","Processing asent: Then they too fell asleep.\n","Processing asent: A sliver of moon rose over the horizon, hardly large enough to make a path of light even when it sat right down on the water; but there were other lights in the sky, that moved fast, winked, or went out, though not even a faint popping came down from the battle fought at ten miles' height.\n","Processing asent: But a sign came down from the world of grownups, though at the time there was no child awake to read it.\n","Processing asent: There was a sudden bright explosion and corkscrew trail across the sky; then darkness again and stars.\n","Processing asent: There was a speck above the island, a figure dropping swiftly beneath a parachute, a figure that hung with dangling limbs.\n","Processing asent: The changing winds of various altitudes took the figure where they would.\n","Processing asent: Then, three miles up, the wind steadied and bore it in a descending curve round the sky and swept it in a great slant across the reef and the lagoon toward the mountain.\n","Processing asent: The figure fell and crumpled among the blue flowers of the mountain-side, but now there was a gentle breeze at this height too and the parachute flopped and banged and pulled.\n","Processing asent: So the figure, with feet that dragged behind it, slid up the mountain.\n","Processing asent: Yard by yard, puff by puff, the breeze hauled the figure through the blue flowers, over the boulders and red stones, till it lay huddled among the shattered rocks of the mountain-top.\n","Processing asent: Here the breeze was fitful and allowed the strings of the parachute to tangle and festoon; and the figure sat, its helmeted head between its knees, held by a complication of lines.\n","Processing asent: When the breeze blew, the lines would strain taut and some accident of this pull lifted the head and chest upright so that the figure seemed to peer across the brow of the mountain.\n","Processing asent: Then, each time the wind dropped, the lines would slacken and the figure bow forward again, sinking its head between its knees.\n","Processing asent: So as the stars moved across the sky, the figure sat on the mountain-top and bowed and sank and bowed again.\n","Processing asent: In the darkness of early morning there were noises by a rock a little way down the side of the mountain.\n","Processing asent: Two boys rolled out a pile of brushwood and dead leaves, two dim shadows talking sleepily to each other.\n","Processing asent: They were the twins, on duty at the fire.\n","Processing asent: In theory one should have been asleep and one on watch.\n","Processing asent: But they could never manage to do things sensibly if that meant acting independently, and since staying awake all night was impossible, they had both gone to sleep.\n","Processing asent: Now they approached the darker smudge that had been the signal fire, yawning, rubbing their eyes, treading with practiced feet.\n","Processing asent: When they reached it they stopped yawning, and one ran quickly back for brushwood and leaves.\n","Processing asent: The other knelt down.\n","Processing asent: \"I believe it's out.\"\n","Processing asent: He fiddled with the sticks that were pushed into his hands.\n","Processing asent: \"No.\"\n","Processing asent: He lay down and put his lips close to the smudge and blew soffly.\n","Processing asent: His face appeared, lit redly.\n","Processing asent: He stopped blowing for a moment.\n","Processing asent: \"Sam--give us--\" \"--tinder wood.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric bent down and blew softly again till the patch was bright. Sam poked the piece of tinder wood into the hot spot, then a branch. The glow increased and the branch took fire. Sam piled on more branches. \"Don't burn the lot,\" said Eric, \"you're putting on too much.\" \"Let's warm up.\" \"We'll only have to fetch more wood.\" \"I'm cold.\" \"So'm I.\" \"Besides, it's--\" \"--dark. All right, then.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric squatted back and watched Sam make up the fire. He built a little tent of dead wood and the fire was safely alight. \"That was near.\" \"He'd have been--\" \"Waxy.\" \"Huh.\"\n","Processing asent: For a few moments the twins watched the fire in silence.\n","Processing asent: Then Eric sniggered.\n","Processing asent: \"Wasn't he waxy?\" \"About the--\" \"Fire and the pig.\" \"Lucky he went for Jack, 'stead of us.\" \"Huh. Remember old Waxy at school?\" \"'Boy--you-are-driving-me-slowly-insane!'\" The twins shared their identical laughter, then remembered the darkness and other things and glanced round uneasily.\n","Processing asent: The flames, busy about the tent, drew their eyes back again.\n","Processing asent: Eric watched the scurrying woodlice that were so frantically unable to avoid the flames, and thought of the first fire--just down there, on the steeper side of the mountain, where now was complete darkness.\n","Processing asent: He did not like to remember it, and looked away at the mountain-top.\n","Processing asent: Warmth radiated now, and beat pleasantly on them.\n","Processing asent: Sam amused himself by fitting branches into the fire as closely as possible.\n","Processing asent: Eric spread out his hands, searching for the distance at which the heat was just bearable.\n","Processing asent: Idly looking beyond the fire, he resettled the scattered rocks from their flat shadows into daylight contours.\n","Processing asent: Just there was the big rock, and the three stones there, that split rock, and there beyond was a gap--just there-- \"Sam.\" \"Huh?\" \"Nothing.\"\n","Processing asent: The flames were mastering the branches, the bark was curling and falling away, the wood exploding.\n","Processing asent: The tent fell inwards and flung a wide circle of light over the mountain-top.\n","Processing asent: \"Sam--\" \"Huh?\" \"Sam! Sam!\"\n","Processing asent: Sam looked at Eric irritably. The intensity of Eric's gaze made the direction in which he looked terrible, for Sam had his back to it. He scrambled round the fire, squatted by Eric, and looked to see. They became motionless, gripped in each other's arms, four unwinking eyes aimed and two mouths open. Far beneath them, the trees of the forest sighed, then roared. The hair on their foreheads fluttered and flames blew out sideways from the fire. Fifteen yards away from them came the plopping noise of fabric blown open. Neither of the boys screamed but the grip of their arms tightened and their mouths grew peaked. For perhaps ten seconds they crouched like that while the flailing fire sent smoke and sparks and waves of inconstant light over the top of the mountain. Then as though they had but one terrified mind between them they scrambled away over the rocks and fled. Ralph was dreaming. He had fallen asleep after what seemed hours of tossing and turning noisily among the dry leaves. Even the sounds of nightmare from the other shelters no longer reached him, for he was back to where he came from, feeding the ponies with sugar over the garden wall. Then someone was shaking his arm, telling him that it was time for tea. \"Ralph! Wake up!\"\n","Processing asent: The leaves were roaring like the sea. \"Ralph, wake up!\" \"What's the matter?\" \"We saw--\" \"--the beast--\" \"--plain!\" \"Who are you? The twins?\" \"We saw the beast--\" \"Quiet. Piggy!\"\n","Processing asent: The leaves were roaring still.\n","Processing asent: Piggy bumped into him and a twin grabbed him as he made for the oblong of paling stars.\n","Processing asent: \"You can't go out--it's horrible!\" \"Piggy--where are the spears?\" \"I can hear the--\" \"Quiet then. Lie still.\"\n","Processing asent: They lay there listening, at first with doubt but then with terror to the description the twins breathed at them between bouts of extreme silence.\n","Processing asent: Soon the darkness was full of claws, full of the awful unknown and menace.\n","Processing asent: An interminable dawn faded the stars out, and at last light, sad and grey, filtered into the shelter.\n","Processing asent: They began to stir though still the world outside the shelter was impossibly dangerous.\n","Processing asent: The maze of the darkness sorted into near and far, and at the high point of the sky the cloudlets were warmed with color.\n","Processing asent: A single sea bird flapped upwards with a hoarse cry that was echoed presently, and something squawked in the forest.\n","Processing asent: Now streaks of cloud near the horizon began to glow rosily, and the feathery tops of the palms were green.\n","Processing asent: Ralph knelt in the entrance to the shelter and peered cautiously round him.\n","Processing asent: \"Sam 'n Eric. Call them to an assembly. Quietly. Go on.\"\n","Processing asent: The twins, holding tremulously to each other, dared the few yards to the next shelter and spread the dreadful news. Ralph stood up and walked for the sake of dignity, though with his back pricking, to the platform. Piggy and Simon followed him and the other boys came sneaking after. Ralph took the conch from where it lay on the polished seat and held it to his lips; but then he hesitated and did not blow. He held the shell up instead and showed it to them and they understood. The rays of the sun that were fanning upwards from below the horizon swung downwards to eye-level. Ralph looked for a moment at the growing slice of gold that lit them from the right hand and seemed to make speech possible. The circle of boys before him bristled with hunting spears. He handed the conch to Eric, the nearest of the twins. \"We've seen the beast with our own eyes. No--we weren't asleep--\"\n","Processing asent: Sam took up the story. By custom now one conch did for both twins, for their substantial unity was recognized. \"It was furry. There was something moving behind its head--wings. The beast moved too--\" \"That was awful. It kind of sat up--\" \"The fire was bright--\" \"We'd just made it up--\" \"--more sticks on--\" \"There were eyes--\" \"Teeth--\" \"Claws--\" \"We ran as fast as we could--\" \"Bashed into things--\" \"The beast followed us--\" \"I saw it slinking behind the trees--\" \"Nearly touched me--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph pointed fearfully at Eric's face, which was striped with scars where the bushes had torn him. \"How did you do that?\"\n","Processing asent: Eric felt his face. \"I'm all rough. Am I bleeding?\"\n","Processing asent: The circle of boys shrank away in horror. Johnny, yawning still, burst into noisy tears and was slapped by Bill till he choked on them. The bright morning was full of threats and the circle began to change. It faced out, rather than in, and the spears of sharpened wood were like a fence. Jack called them back to the center. \"This'll be a real hunt! Who'll come?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph moved impatiently. \"These spears are made of wood. Don't be silly.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack sneered at him. \"Frightened?\" \"'Course I'm frightened. Who wouldn't be?\"\n","Processing asent: He turned to the twins, yearning but hopeless. \"I suppose you aren't pulling our legs?\"\n","Processing asent: The reply was too emphatic for anyone to doubt them. Piggy took the conch. \"Couldn't we--kind of--stay here? Maybe the beast won't come near us.\"\n","Processing asent: But for the sense of something watching them, Ralph would have shouted at him. \"Stay here? And be cramped into this bit of the island, always on the lookout? How should we get our food? And what about the fire?\" \"Let's be moving,\" said Jack relentlessly, \"we're wasting time.\" \"No we're not. What about the littluns?\" \"Sucks to the littluns!\" \"Someone's got to look after them.\" \"Nobody has so far.\" \"There was no need! Now there is. Piggy'll look after them.\" \"That's right. Keep Piggy out of danger.\" \"Have some sense. What can Piggy do with only one eye?\"\n","Processing asent: The rest of the boys were looking from Jack to Ralph, curiously. \"And another thing. You can't have an ordinary hunt because the beast doesn't leave tracks. If it did you'd have seen them. For all we know, the beast may swing through the trees like what's its name.\"\n","Processing asent: They nodded. \"So we've got to think.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy took off his damaged glasses and cleaned the remaining lens. \"How about us, Ralph?\" \"You haven't got the conch. Here.\" \"I mean--how about us? Suppose the beast comes when you're all away. I can't see proper, and if I get scared--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack broke in, contemptuously. \"You're always scared.\" \"I got the conch--\" \"Conch! Conch!\" shouted Jack. \"We don't need the conch any more. We know who ought to say things. What good did Simon do speaking, or Bill, or Walter? It's time some people knew they've got to keep quiet and leave deciding things to the rest of us.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph could no longer ignore his speech. The blood was hot in his cheeks. \"You haven't got the conch,\" he said. \"Sit down.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack's face went so white that the freckles showed as clear, brown flecks. He licked his lips and remained standing. \"This is a hunter's job.\"\n","Processing asent: The rest of the boys watched intently. Piggy, finding himself uncomfortably embroiled, slid the conch to Ralph's knees and sat down. The silence grew oppressive and Piggy held his breath. \"This is more than a hunter's job,\" said Ralph at last, \"because you can't track the beast. And don't you want to be rescued?\"\n","Processing asent: He turned to the assembly. \"Don't you all want to be rescued?\"\n","Processing asent: He looked back at Jack. \"I said before, the fire is the main thing. Now the fire must be out--\"\n","Processing asent: The old exasperation saved him and gave him the energy to attack. \"Hasn't anyone got any sense? We've got to relight that fire. You never thought of that, Jack, did you? Or don't any of you want to be rescued?\"\n","Processing asent: Yes, they wanted to be rescued, there was no doubt about that; and with a violent swing to Ralph's side, the crisis passed. Piggy let out his breath with a gasp, reached for it again and failed. He lay against a log, his mouth gaping, blue shadows creeping round his lips. Nobody minded him. \"Now think, Jack. Is there anywhere on the island you haven't been?\"\n","Processing asent: Unwillingly Jack answered. \"There's only--but of course! You remember? The tail-end part, where the rocks are all piled up. I've been near there. The rock makes a sort of bridge. There's only one way up.\" \"And the thing might live there.\"\n","Processing asent: All the assembly talked at once. \"Quite! All right. That's where we'll look. If the beast isn't there we'll go up the mountain and look; and light the fire.\" \"Let's go.\" \"We'll eat first. Then go.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph paused. \"We'd better take spears.\"\n","Processing asent: After they had eaten, Ralph and the biguns set out along the beach. They left Piggy propped up on the platform. This day promised, like the others, to be a sunbath under a blue dome. The beach stretched away before them in a gentle curve till perspective drew it into one with the forest; for the day was not advanced enough to be obscured by the shifting veils of mirage. Under Ralph's direction, they picked up a careful way along the palm terrace, rather than dare the hot sand down by the water. He let Jack lead the way; and Jack trod with theatrical caution though they could have seen an enemy twenty yards away. Ralph walked in the rear, thankful to have escaped responsibility for a time. Simon, walking in front of Ralph, felt a flicker of incredulity--a beast with claws that scratched, that sat on a mountain-top, that left no tracks and yet was not fast enough to catch Samneric. However Simon thought of the beast, there rose before his inward sight the picture of a human at once heroic and sick. He sighed. Other people could stand up and speak to an assembly, apparently, without that dreadful feeling of the pressure of personality; could say what they would as though they were speaking to only one person. He stepped aside and looked back. Ralph was coming along, holding his spear over his shoulder. Diffidently, Simon allowed his pace to slacken until he was walking side by side with Ralph and looking up at him through the coarse black hair that now fell to his eyes. Ralph glanced sideways, smiled constrainedly as though he had forgotten that Simon had made a fool of himself, then looked away again at nothing. For a moment or two Simon was happy to be accepted and then he ceased to think about himself. When he bashed into a tree Ralph looked sideways impatiently and Robert sniggered. Simon reeled and a white spot on his forehead turned red and trickled. Ralph dismissed Simon and returned to his personal hell. They would reach the castle some time; and the chief would have to go forward. Jack came trotting back. \"We're in sight now.\" \"All right. We'll get as close as we can.\"\n","Processing asent: He followed Jack toward the castle where the ground rose slightly. On their left was an impenetrable tangle of creepers and trees. \"Why couldn't there be something in that?\" \"Because you can see. Nothing goes in or out.\" \"What about the castle then?\" \"Look.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph parted the screen of grass and looked out. There were only a few more yards of stony ground and then the two sides of the island came almost together so that one expected a peak of headland. But instead of this a narrow ledge of rock, a few yards wide and perhaps fifteen long, continued the island out into the sea. There lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island. This side of the castle, perhaps a hundred feet high, was the pink bastion they had seen from the mountain-top. The rock of the cliff was split and the top littered with great lumps that seemed to totter. Behind Ralph the tall grass had filled with silent hunters. Ralph looked at Jack. \"You're a hunter.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack went red. \"I know. All right.\"\n","Processing asent: Something deep in Ralph spoke for him. \"I'm chief. I'll go. Don't argue.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned to the others. \"You. Hide here. Wait for me.\"\n","Processing asent: He found his voice tended either to disappear or to come out too loud. He looked at Jack. \"Do you--think?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack muttered. \"I've been all over. It must be here.\" \"I see.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon mumbled confusedly: \"I don't believe in the beast.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph answered him politely, as if agreeing about the weather. \"No. I suppose not.\"\n","Processing asent: His mouth was tight and pale. He put back his hair very slowly. \"Well. So long.\"\n","Processing asent: He forced his feet to move until they had carried him out on to the neck of land. He was surrounded on all sides by chasms of empty air. There was nowhere to hide, even if one did not have to go on. He paused on the narrow neck and looked down. Soon, in a matter of centuries, the sea would make an island of the castle. On the right hand was the lagoon, troubled by the open sea; and on the left-- Ralph shuddered. The lagoon had protected them from the Pacific: and for some reason only Jack had gone right down to the water on the other side. Now he saw the landsman's view of the swell and it seemed like the breathing of some stupendous creature. Slowly the waters sank among the rocks, revealing pink tables of granite, strange growths of coral, polyp, and weed. Down, down, the waters went, whispering like the wind among the heads of the forest. There was one flat rock there, spread like a table, and the waters sucking down on the four weedy sides made them seem like cliffs. Then the sleeping leviathan breathed out, the waters rose, the weed streamed, and the water boiled over the table rock with a roar. There was no sense of the passage of waves; only this minute-long fall and rise and fall. Ralph turned away to the red cliff. They were waiting behind him in the long grass, waiting to see what he would do. He noticed that the sweat in his palm was cool now; realized with surprise that he did not really expect to meet any beast and didn't know what he would do about it if he did. He saw that he could climb the cliff but this was not necessary. The squareness of the rock allowed a sort of plinth round it, so that to the right, over the lagoon, one could inch along a ledge and turn the corner out of sight. It was easy going, and soon he was peering round the rock. Nothing but what you might expect: pink, tumbled boulders with guano layered on them like icing; and a steep slope up to the shattered rocks that crowned the bastion. A sound behind him made him turn. Jack was edging along the ledge. \"Couldn't let you do it on your own.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph said nothing. He led the way over the rocks, inspected a sort of half-cave that held nothing more terrible than a clutch of rotten eggs, and at last sat down, looking round him and tapping the rock with the butt of his spear. Jack was excited. \"What a place for a fort!\"\n","Processing asent: A column of spray wetted them. \"No fresh water.\" \"What's that then?\"\n","Processing asent: There was indeed a long green smudge half-way up the rock. They climbed up and tasted the trickle of water. \"You could keep a coconut shell there, filling all the time.\" \"Not me. This is a rotten place.\"\n","Processing asent: Side by side they scaled the last height to where the diminishing pile was crowned by the last broken rock. Jack struck the near one with his fist and it grated slightly. \"Do you remember--?\"\n","Processing asent: Consciousness of the bad times in between came to them both. Jack talked quickly. \"Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy came-- look!\"\n","Processing asent: A hundred feet below them was the narrow causeway, then the stony ground, then the grass dotted with heads, and behind that the forest. \"One heave,\" cried Jack, exulting, \"and--wheee--!\"\n","Processing asent: He made a sweeping movement with his hand. Ralph looked toward the mountain. \"What's the matter?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned. \"Why?\" \"You were looking--I don't know why.\" \"There's no signal now. Nothing to show.\" \"You're nuts on the signal.\"\n","Processing asent: The taut blue horizon encircled them, broken only by the mountain-top. \"That's all we've got.\"\n","Processing asent: He leaned his spear against the rocking stone and pushed back two handfuls of hair. \"We'll have to go back and climb the mountain. That's where they saw the beast.\" \"The beast won't be there.\" \"What else can we do?\"\n","Processing asent: The others, waiting in the grass, saw Jack and Ralph unharmed and broke cover into the sunlight. They forgot the beast in the excitement of exploration. They swarmed across the bridge and soon were climbing and shouting. Ralph stood now, one hand against an enormous red block, a block large as a mill wheel that had been split off and hung, tottering. Somberly he watched the mountain. He clenched his fist and beat hammer-wise on the red wall at his right. His lips were tightly compressed and his eyes yearned beneath the fringe of hair. \"Smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: He sucked his bruised fist. \"Jack! Come on.\"\n","Processing asent: But Jack was not there. A knot of boys, making a great noise that he had not noticed, were heaving and pushing at a rock. As he turned, the base cracked and the whole mass toppled into the sea so that a thunderous plume of spray leapt half-way up the cliff. \"Stop it! Stop it!\"\n","Processing asent: His voice struck a silence among them. \"Smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: A strange thing happened in his head. Something flittered there in front of his mind like a bat's wing, obscuring his idea. \"Smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: At once the ideas were back, and the anger. \"We want smoke. And you go wasting your time. You roll rocks.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger shouted. \"We've got plenty of time!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shook his head. \"We'll go to the mountain.\"\n","Processing asent: The clamor broke out. Some of the boys wanted to go back to the beach. Some wanted to roll more rocks. The sun was bright and danger had faded with the darkness. \"Jack. The beast might be on the other side. You can lead again. You've been.\" \"We could go by the shore. There's fruit.\"\n","Processing asent: Bill came up to Ralph. \"Why can't we stay here for a bit?\" \"That's right.'' \"Let's have a fort.\n","Processing asent: \" \"There's no food here,\" said Ralph, \"and no shelter.\n","Processing asent: Not much fresh water.\n","Processing asent: \" \"This would make a wizard fort.\n","Processing asent: \" \"We can roll rocks--\" \"Right onto the bridge--\" \"I say we'll go on!\" shouted Ralph furiously. \"We've got to make certain.\n","Processing asent: We'll go now.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Let's stay here--\" \"Back to the shelter--\" \"I'm tired--\" \"No!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph struck the skin off his knuckles. They did not seem to hurt. \"I'm chief.\n","Processing asent: We've got to make certain.\n","Processing asent: Can't you see the mountain?\n","Processing asent: There's no signal showing.\n","Processing asent: There may be a ship out there.\n","Processing asent: Are you all off your rockers?\"\n","Processing asent: Mutinously, the boys fell silent or muttering. Jack led the way down the rock and across the bridge. CHAPTER SEVEN  Shadows and Tall Trees The pig-run kept close to the jumble of rocks that lay down by the water on the other side and Ralph was content to follow Jack along it. If you could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the return, if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts on either side, then there was a chance that you might put the beast out of mind and dream for a while. The sun had swung over the vertical and the afternoon heat was closing in on the island. Ralph passed a message forward to Jack and when they next came to fruit the whole party stopped and ate. Sitting, Ralph was aware of the heat for the first time that day. He pulled distastefully at his grey shirt and wondered whether he might undertake the adventure of washing it. Sitting under what seemed an unusual heat, even for this island, Ralph planned his toilet. He would like to have a pair of scissors and cut this hair--he flung the mass back--cut this filthy hair right back to half an inch. He would like to have a bath, a proper wallow with soap. He passed his tongue experimentally over his teeth and decided that a toothbrush would come in handy too. Then there were his nails-- Ralph turned his hand over and examined them. They were bitten down to the quick though he could not remember when he had restarted this habit nor any time when he indulged it. \"Be sucking my thumb next--\"\n","Processing asent: He looked round, furtively. Apparently no one had heard. The hunters sat, stuffing themselves with this easy meal, trying to convince themselves that they got sufficient kick out of bananas and that other olive-grey, jelly-like fruit. With the memory of his sometime clean self as a standard, Ralph looked them over. They were dirty, not with the spectacular dirt of boys who have fallen into mud or been brought down hard on a rainy day. Not one of them was an obvious subject for a shower, and yet--hair, much too long, tangled here and there, knotted round a dead leaf or a twig; faces cleaned fairly well by the process of eating and sweating but marked in the less accessible angles with a kind of shadow; clothes, worn away, stiff like his own with sweat, put on, not for decorum or comfort but out of custom; the skin of the body, scurfy with brine-- He discovered with a little fall of the heart that these were the conditions he took as normal now and that he did not mind. He sighed and pushed away the stalk from which he had stripped the fruit. Already the hunters were stealing away to do their business in the woods or down by the rocks. He turned and looked out to sea. Here, on the other side of the island, the view was utterly different. The filmy enchantments of mirage could not endure the cold ocean water and the horizon was hard, clipped blue. Ralph wandered down to the rocks. Down here, almost on a level with the sea, you could follow with your eye the ceaseless, bulging passage of the deep sea waves. They were miles wide, apparently not breakers or the banked ridges of shallow water. They traveled the length of the island with an air of disregarding it and being set on other business; they were less a progress than a momentous rise and fall of the whole ocean. Now the sea would suck down, making cascades and waterfalls of retreating water, would sink past the rocks and plaster down the seaweed like shining hair: then, pausing, gather and rise with a roar, irresistibly swelling over point and outcrop, climbing the little cliff, sending at last an arm of surf up a gully to end a yard or so from him in fingers of spray. Wave after wave, Ralph followed the rise and fall until something of the remoteness of the sea numbed his brain. Then gradually the almost infinite size of this water forced itself on his attention. This was the divider, the barrier. On the other side of the island, swathed at midday with mirage, defended by the shield of the quiet lagoon, one might dream of rescue; but here, faced by the brute obtuseness of the ocean, the miles of division, one was clamped down, one was helpless, one was condemned, one was-- Simon was speaking almost in his ear. Ralph found that he had rock painfully gripped in both hands, found his body arched, the muscles of his neck stiff, his mouth strained open. \"You'll get back to where you came from.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon nodded as he spoke. He was kneeling on one knee, looking down from a higher rock which he held with both hands; his other leg stretched down to Ralph's level. Ralph was puzzled and searched Simon's face for a clue. \"It's so big, I mean--\"\n","Processing asent: Simon nodded. \"All the same.\n","Processing asent: You'll get back all right.\n","Processing asent: I think so, anyway.\n","Processing asent: \" Some of the strain had gone from Ralph's body. He glanced at the sea and then smiled bitterly at Simon. \"Got a ship in your pocket?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon grinned and shook his head. \"How do you know, then?\"\n","Processing asent: When Simon was still silent Ralph said curtly, \"You're batty.\n","Processing asent: \" Simon shook his head violently till the coarse black hair flew backwards and forwards across his face. \"No, I'm not.\n","Processing asent: I just _think you'll get back all right._\" For a moment nothing more was said. And then they suddenly smiled at each other. Roger called from the coverts. \"Come and see!\"\n","Processing asent: The ground was turned over near the pig-run and there were droppings that steamed. Jack bent down to them as though he loved them. \"Ralph--we need meat even if we are hunting the other thing.\" \"If you mean going the right way, we'll hunt.\"\n","Processing asent: They set off again, the hunters bunched a little by fear of the mentioned beast, while Jack quested ahead. They went more slowly than Ralph had bargained for; yet in a way he was glad to loiter, cradling his spear. Jack came up against some emergency of his craft and soon the procession stopped. Ralph leaned against a tree and at once the daydreams came swarming up. Jack was in charge of the hunt and there would be time to get to the mountain-- Once, following his father from Chatham to Devonport, they had lived in a cottage on the edge of the moors. In the succession of houses that Ralph had known, this one stood out with particular clarity because after that house he had been sent away to school. Mummy had still been with them and Daddy had come home every day. Wild ponies came to the stone wall at the bottom of the garden, and it had snowed. Just behind the cottage there was a sort of shed and you could lie up there, watching the flakes swirl past. You could see the damp spot where each flake died, then you could mark the first flake that lay down without melting and watch, the whole ground turn white. You could go indoors when you were cold and look out of the window, past the bright copper kettle and the plate with the little blue men. When you went to bed there was a bowl of cornflakes with sugar and cream. And the books--they stood on the shelf by the bed, leaning together with always two or three laid flat on top because he had not bothered to put them back properly. They were dog-eared and scratched. There was the bright, shining one about Topsy and Mopsy that he never read because it was about two girls; there was the one about the magician which you read with a kind of tied-down terror, skipping page twenty-seven with the awful picture of the spider; there was a book about people who had dug things up, Egyptian things; there was _The Boy's Book of Trains_, _The Boy's Book of Ships_. Vividly they came before him; he could have reached up and touched them, could feel the weight and slow slide with which _The Mammoth Book for Boys_ would come out and slither down. . . . Everything was all right; everything was good-humored and friendly. The bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themselves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers, screaming. Ralph saw Jack nudged aside and fall. Then there was a creature bounding along the pig track toward him, with tusks gleaming and an intimidating grunt. Ralph found he was able to measure the distance coldly and take aim. With the boar only five yards away, he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried, saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment. The boar's note changed to a squeal and it swerved aside into the covert. The pig-run filled with shouting boys again, Jack came running back, and poked about in the undergrowth. \"Through here--\" \"But he'd do us!\" \"Through here, I said--\"\n","Processing asent: The boar was floundering away from them. They found another pig-run parallel to the first and Jack raced away. Ralph was full of fright and apprehension and pride. \"I hit him!\n","Processing asent: The spear stuck in--\"\n","Processing asent: Now they came, unexpectedly, to an open space by the sea. Jack cast about on the bare rock and looked anxious. \"He's gone.\" \"I hit him,\" said Ralph again, \"and the spear stuck in a bit.\"\n","Processing asent: He felt the need of witnesses. \"Didn't you see me?\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice nodded. \"I saw you. Right bang on his snout--Wheee!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph talked on, excitedly. \"I hit him all right.\n","Processing asent: The spear stuck in.\n","Processing asent: I wounded him!\"\n","Processing asent: He sunned himself in their new respect and felt that hunting was good after all. \"I walloped him properly.\n","Processing asent: That was the beast, I think!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack came back. \"That wasn't the beast.\n","Processing asent: That was a boar.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I hit him.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Why didn't you grab him?\n","Processing asent: I tried--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's voice ran up. \"But a boar!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack flushed suddenly. \"You said he'd do us. What did you want to throw for? Why didn't you wait? He held out his arm. \"Look.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned his left forearm for them all to see. On the outside was a rip; not much, but bloody. \"He did that with his tusks. I couldn't get my spear down in time.\"\n","Processing asent: Attention focused on Jack. \"That's a wound,\" said Simon, \"and you ought to suck it. Like Berengaria.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack sucked. \"I hit him,\" said Ralph indignantly. \"I hit him with my spear, I wounded him.\"\n","Processing asent: He tried for their attention. \"He was coming along the path. I threw, like this--\"\n","Processing asent: Robert snarled at him.\n","Processing asent: Ralph entered into the play and everybody laughed.\n","Processing asent: Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.\n","Processing asent: Jack shouted.\n","Processing asent: \"Make a ring!\"\n","Processing asent: The circle moved in and round.\n","Processing asent: Robert squealed in mock terror, then in real pain.\n","Processing asent: \"Ow! Stop it! You're hurting!\"\n","Processing asent: The butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.\n","Processing asent: \"Hold him!\"\n","Processing asent: They got his arms and legs.\n","Processing asent: Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric's spear and jabbed at Robert with it.\n","Processing asent: \"Kill him! Kill him!\"\n","Processing asent: All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy.\n","Processing asent: Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife.\n","Processing asent: Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close.\n","Processing asent: The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.\n","Processing asent: \"_Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!_\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh.\n","Processing asent: The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering.\n","Processing asent: Jack's arm came down; the heaving circle cheered and made pig-dying noises.\n","Processing asent: Then they lay quiet, panting, listening to Robert's frightened snivels.\n","Processing asent: He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an effort to retrieve his status.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, my bum!\"\n","Processing asent: He rubbed his rump ruefully.\n","Processing asent: Jack rolled over.\n","Processing asent: \"That was a good game.\" \"Just a game,\" said Ralph uneasily.\n","Processing asent: \"I got jolly badly hurt at rugger once.\" \"We ought to have a drum,\" said Maurice, \"then we could do it properly.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him.\n","Processing asent: \"How properly?\" \"I dunno. You want a fire, I think, and a drum, and you keep time to the drum. \"You want a pig,\" said Roger, \"like a real hunt.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Or someone to pretend,\" said Jack. \"You could get someone to dress up as a pig and then he could act--you know, pretend to knock me over and all that.\n","Processing asent: \" \"You want a real pig,\" said Robert, still caressing his rump, \"because you've got to kill him.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Use a littlun,\" said Jack, and everybody laughed. Ralph sat up. \"Well.\n","Processing asent: We shan't find what we're looking for at this rate.\n","Processing asent: \" One by one they stood up, twitching rags into place. Ralph looked at Jack. \"Now for the mountain.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Shouldn't we go back to Piggy,\" said Maurice, \"before dark?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins nodded like one boy. \"Yes, that's right.\n","Processing asent: Let's go up there in the morning.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph looked out and saw the sea. \"We've got to start the fire again.\n","Processing asent: \" \"You haven't got Piggy's specs,\" said Jack, \"so you can't.\n","Processing asent: '' \"Then we'll find out if the mountain's clear.\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice spoke, hesitating, not wanting to seem a funk.\n","Processing asent: \"Supposing the beast's up there?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack brandished his spear.\n","Processing asent: \"We'll kill it.\"\n","Processing asent: The sun seemed a little cooler.\n","Processing asent: He slashed with the spear.\n","Processing asent: \"What are we waiting for?\" \"I suppose,\" said Ralph, \"if we keep on by the sea this way, we'll come out below the burnt bit and then we can climb the mountain. Once more Jack led them along by the suck and heave of the blinding sea. Once more Ralph dreamed, letting his skillful feet deal with the difficulties of the path. Yet here his feet seemed less skillful than before. For most of the way they were forced right down to the bare rock by the water and had to edge along between that and the dark luxuriance of the forest. There were little cliffs to be scaled, some to be used as paths, lengthy traverses where one used hands as well as feet. Here and there they could clamber over wavewet rock, leaping across clear pools that the tide had left. They came to a gully that split the narrow foreshore like a defense. This seemed to have no bottom and they peered awe-stricken into the gloomy crack where water gurgled. Then the wave came back, the gully boiled before them and spray dashed up to the very creeper so that the boys were wet and shrieking. They tried the forest but it was thick and woven like a bird's nest. In the end they had to jump one by one, waiting till the water sank; and even so, some of them got a second drenching. After that the rocks seemed to be growing impassable so they sat for a time, letting their rags dry and watching the clipped outlines of the rollers that moved so slowly past the island. They found fruit in a haunt of bright little birds that hovered like insects. Then Ralph said they were going too slowly. He himself climbed a tree and parted the canopy, and saw the square head of the mountain seeming still a great way off. Then they tried to hurry along the rocks and Robert cut his knee quite badly and they had to recognize that this path must be taken slowly if they were to be safe. So they proceeded after that as if they were climbing a dangerous mountain, until the rocks became an uncompromising cliff, overhung with impossible jungle and falling sheer into the sea. Ralph looked at the sun critically. \"Early evening.\n","Processing asent: After tea-time, at any rate.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I don't remember this cliff,\" said Jack, crestfallen, \"so this must be the bit of the coast I missed.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph nodded. \"Let me think.\n","Processing asent: \" By now, Ralph had no self-consciousness in public thinking but would treat the day's decisions as though he were playing chess. The only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player. He thought of the littluns and Piggy. Vividly he imagined Piggy by himself, huddled in a shelter that was silent except for the sounds of nightmare. \"We can't leave the littluns alone with Piggy.\n","Processing asent: Not all night.\n","Processing asent: \" The other boys said nothing but stood round, watching him. \"If we went back we should take hours.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack cleared his throat and spoke in a queer, tight voice. \"We mustn't let anything happen to Piggy, must we?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph tapped his teeth with the dirty point of Eric's spear. \"If we go across--\"\n","Processing asent: He glanced round him. \"Someone's got to go across the island and tell Piggy we'll be back after dark.\"\n","Processing asent: Bill spoke, unbelieving. \"Through the forest by himself? Now?\" \"We can't spare more than one.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon pushed his way to Ralph's elbow. \"I'll go if you like. I don't mind, honestly.\"\n","Processing asent: Before Ralph had time to reply, he smiled quickly, turned and climbed into the forest. Ralph looked back at Jack, seeing him, infuriatingly, for the first time. \"Jack--that time you went the whole way to the castle rock.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack glowered. \"Yes?\" \"You came along part of this shore--below the mountain, beyond there.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Yes.\n","Processing asent: \" \"And then?\" \"I found a pig-run.\n","Processing asent: It went for miles.\n","Processing asent: \" \"So the pig-run must be somewhere in there.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph nodded. He pointed at the forest. Everybody agreed, sagely. \"All right then.\n","Processing asent: We'll smash a way through till we find the pig-run.\n","Processing asent: \" He took a step and halted. \"Wait a minute though!\n","Processing asent: Where does the pig-run go to?\" \"The mountain,\" said Jack, \"I told you.\n","Processing asent: \" He sneered. \"Don't you want to go to the mountain?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph sighed, sensing the rising antagonism, understanding that this was how Jack felt as soon as he ceased to lead. \"I was thinking of the light.\n","Processing asent: We'll be stumbling about.\n","Processing asent: \" \"We were going to look for the beast.\n","Processing asent: \" \"There won't be enough light.\n","Processing asent: \" \"I don't mind going,\" said Jack hotly. \"I'll go when we get there.\n","Processing asent: Won't you?\n","Processing asent: Would you rather go back to the shelters and tell Piggy?\"\n","Processing asent: Now it was Ralph's turn to flush but he spoke despairingly, out of the new understanding that Piggy had given him. \"Why do you hate me?\"\n","Processing asent: The boys stirred uneasily, as though something indecent had been said. The silence lengthened. Ralph, still hot and hurt, turned away first. \"Come on.\n","Processing asent: \" He led the way and set himself as by right to hack at the tangles. Jack brought up the rear, displaced and brooding. The pig-track was a dark tunnel, for the sun was sliding quickly toward the edge of the world and in the forest shadows were never far to seek. The track was broad and beaten and they ran along at a swift trot. Then the roof of leaves broke up and they halted, breathing quickly, looking at the few stars that pricked round the head of the mountain. \"There you are.\n","Processing asent: \" The boys peered at each other doubtfully. Ralph made a decision. \"We'll go straight across to the platform and climb tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: \" They murmured agreement; but Jack was standing by his shoulder. \"If you're frightened of course--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned on him. \"Who went first on the castle rock?\" \"I went too. And that was daylight.\" \"All right. Who wants to climb the mountain now?\"\n","Processing asent: Silence was the only answer. \"Samneric? What about you?\" \"We ought to go an' tell Piggy--\" \"--yes, tell Piggy that--\" \"But Simon went!\" \"We ought to tell Piggy--in case--\" \"Robert?\n","Processing asent: Bill?\"\n","Processing asent: They were going straight back to the platform now. Not, of course, that they were afraid--but tired. Ralph turned back to Jack. \"You see?\" \"I'm going up the mountain.\"\n","Processing asent: The words came from Jack viciously, as though they were a curse. He looked at Ralph, his thin body tensed, his spear held as if he threatened him. \"I'm going up the mountain to look for the beast--now.\n","Processing asent: \" Then the supreme sting, the casual, bitter word. \"Coming?\"\n","Processing asent: At that word the other boys forgot their urge to be gone and turned back to sample this fresh rub of two spirits in the dark. The word was too good, too bitter, too successfully daunting to be repeated. It took Ralph at low water when his nerve was relaxed for the return to the shelter and the still, friendly waters of the lagoon. \"I don't mind.\n","Processing asent: \" Astonished, he heard his voice come out, cool and casual, so that the bitterness of Jack's taunt fell powerless. \"If you don't mind, of course.\n","Processing asent: \" \"Oh, not at all.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack took a step. \"Well then--\"\n","Processing asent: Side by side, watched by silent boys, the two started up the mountain. Ralph stopped. \"We're silly. Why should only two go? If we find anything, two won't be enough.\"\n","Processing asent: There came the sound of boys scuttling away. Astonishingly, a dark figure moved against the tide. \"Roger?\" \"Yes.\" \"That's three, then.\"\n","Processing asent: Once more they set out to climb the slope of the mountain. The darkness seemed to flow round them like a tide. Jack, who had said nothing, began to choke and cough, and a gust of wind set all three spluttering. Ralph's eyes were blinded with tears. \"Ashes. We're on the edge of the burnt patch.\"\n","Processing asent: Their footsteps and the occasional breeze were stirring up small devils of dust. Now that they stopped again, Ralph had time while he coughed to remember how silly they were. If there was no beast--and almost certainly there was no beast--in that case, well and good; but if there was something waiting on top of the mountain-- what was the use of three of them, handicapped by the darkness and carrying only sticks? \"We're being fools.\n","Processing asent: \" Out of the darkness came the answer. \"Windy?\"\n","Processing asent: Irritably Ralph shook himself. This was all Jack's fault. \"'Course I am.\n","Processing asent: But we're still being fools.\n","Processing asent: \" \"If you don't want to go on,\" said the voice sarcastically, \"I'll go up by myself.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph heard the mockery and hated Jack. The sting of ashes in his eyes, tiredness, fear, enraged him. \"Go on then!\n","Processing asent: We'll wait here.\n","Processing asent: \" There was silence. \"Why don't you go?\n","Processing asent: Are you frightened?\"\n","Processing asent: A stain in the darkness, a stain that was Jack, detached itself and began to draw away. \"All right.\n","Processing asent: So long.\n","Processing asent: \" The stain vanished. Another took its place. Ralph felt his knee against something hard and rocked a charred trunk that was edgy to the touch. He felt the sharp cinders that had been bark push against the back of his knee and knew that Roger had sat down. He felt with his hands and lowered himself beside Roger, while the trunk rocked among invisible ashes. Roger, uncommunicative by nature, said nothing. He offered no opinion on the beast nor told Ralph why he had chosen to come on this mad expedition. He simply sat and rocked the trunk gently. Ralph noticed a rapid and infuriating tapping noise and realized that Roger was banging his silly wooden stick against something. So they sat, the rocking, tapping, impervious Roger and Ralph, fuming; round them the close sky was loaded with stars, save where the mountain punched up a hole of blackness. There was a slithering noise high above them, the sound of someone taking giant and dangerous strides on rock or ash. Then Jack found them, and was shivering and croaking in a voice they could just recognize as his. \"I saw a thing on top.\n","Processing asent: \" They heard him blunder against the trunk which rocked violently. He lay silent for a moment, then muttered. \"Keep a good lookout.\n","Processing asent: It may be following.\n","Processing asent: \" A shower of ash pattered round them. Jack sat up. \"I saw a thing bulge on the mountain.\n","Processing asent: \" \"You only imagined it,\" said Ralph shakily, \"because nothing would bulge.\n","Processing asent: Not any sort of creature.\n","Processing asent: \" Roger spoke; they jumped, for they had forgotten him. \"A frog.\n","Processing asent: \" Jack giggled and shuddered. \"Some frog.\n","Processing asent: There was a noise too.\n","Processing asent: A kind of 'plop' noise.\n","Processing asent: Then the thing bulged.\n","Processing asent: \" Ralph surprised himself, not so much by the quality of his voice, which was even, but by the bravado of its intention. \"We'll go and look.\n","Processing asent: \" For the first time since he had first known Jack, Ralph could feel him hesitate. \"Now--?\"\n","Processing asent: His voice spoke for him. \"Of course.\n","Processing asent: \" He got off the trunk and led the way across the clinking cinders up into the dark, and the others followed. Now that his physical voice was silent the inner voice of reason, and other voices too, made themselves heard. Piggy was calling him a kid. Another voice told him not to be a fool; and the darkness and desperate enterprise gave the night a kind of dentist's chair unreality. As they came to the last slope, Jack and Roger drew near, changed from the ink-stains to distinguishable figures. By common consent they stopped and crouched together. Behind them, on the horizon, was a patch of lighter sky where in a moment the moon would rise. The wind roared once in the forest and pushed their rags against them. Ralph stirred. \"Come on.\n","Processing asent: \" They crept forward, Roger lagging a little. Jack and Ralph turned the shoulder of the mountain together. The glittering lengths of the lagoon lay below them and beyond that a long white smudge that was the reef. Roger joined them. Jack whispered. \"Let's creep forward on hands and knees.\n","Processing asent: Maybe it's asleep.\n","Processing asent: \" Roger and Ralph moved on, this time leaving Jack in the rear, for all his brave words. They came to the flat top where the rock was hard to hands and knees. A creature that bulged. Ralph put his hand in the cold, soft ashes of the fire and smothered a cry. His hand and shoulder were twitching from the unlooked-for contact. Green lights of nausea appeared for a moment and ate into the darkness. Roger lay behind him and Jack's mouth was at his ear. \"Over there, where there used to be a gap in the rock.\n","Processing asent: A sort of hump--see?\"\n","Processing asent: Ashes blew into Ralph's face from the dead fire. He could not see the gap or anything else, because the green lights were opening again and growing, and the top of the mountain was sliding sideways. Once more, from a distance, he heard Jack's whisper. \"Scared?\"\n","Processing asent: Not scared so much as paralyzed; hung up there immovable on the top of a diminishing, moving mountain. Jack slid away from him, Roger bumped, fumbled with a hiss of breath, and passed onwards. He heard them whispering. \"Can you see anything?\" \"There--\"\n","Processing asent: In front of them, only three or four yards away, was a rock-like hump where no rock should be. Ralph could hear a tiny chattering noise coming from somewhere-- perhaps from his own mouth. He bound himself together with his will, fused his fear and loathing into a hatred, and stood up. He took two leaden steps forward. Behind them the silver of moon had drawn clear of the horizon. Before them, something like a great ape was sitting asleep with its head between its knees. Then the wind roared in the forest, there was confusion in the darkness and the creature lifted its head, holding toward them the ruin of a face. Ralph found himself taking giant strides among the ashes, heard other creatures crying out and leaping and dared the impossible on the dark slope; presently the mountain was deserted, save for the three abandoned sticks and the thing that bowed. CHAPTER EIGHT  Gift for the Darkness Piggy looked up miserably from the dawn-pale beach to the dark mountain. \"Are you sure?\n","Processing asent: Really sure, I mean?\"\n","Processing asent: I told you a dozen times now,\" said Ralph, \"we saw it.\" \"D'you think we're safe down here?\" \"How the hell should I know?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph jerked away from him and walked a few paces along the beach.\n","Processing asent: Jack was kneeling and drawing a circular pattern in the sand with his forefinger.\n","Processing asent: Piggy's voice came to them, hushed.\n","Processing asent: \"Are you sure? Really?\" \"Go up and see,\" said Jack contemptuously, \"and good riddance.\" \"No fear.\" \"The beast had teeth,\" said Ralph, \"and big black eyes.\"\n","Processing asent: He shuddered violently.\n","Processing asent: Piggy took off his one round of glass and polished the surface.\n","Processing asent: \"What we going to do?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned toward the platform.\n","Processing asent: The conch glimmered among the trees, a white blob against the place where the sun would rise.\n","Processing asent: He pushed back his mop.\n","Processing asent: \"I don't know.\"\n","Processing asent: He remembered the panic flight down the mountainside.\n","Processing asent: \"I don't think we'd ever fight a thing that size, honestly, you know. We'd talk but we wouldn't fight a tiger. We'd hide. Even Jack 'ud hide.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack still looked at the sand. \"What about my hunters?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon came stealing out of the shadows by the shelters. Ralph ignored Jack's question. He pointed to the touch of yellow above the sea. \"As long as there's light we're brave enough. But then? And now that thing squats by the fire as though it didn't want us to be rescued--\"\n","Processing asent: He was twisting his hands now, unconsciously. His voice rose. \"So we can't have a signal fire. . . . We're beaten.\"\n","Processing asent: A point of gold appeared above the sea and at once all the sky lightened. \"What about my hunters?\" \"Boys armed with sticks.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack got to his feet. His face was red as he marched away. Piggy put on his one glass and looked at Ralph. \"Now you done it. You been rude about his hunters.\" \"Oh shut up!\"\n","Processing asent: The sound of the inexpertly blown conch interrupted them. As though he were serenading the rising sun, Jack went on blowing till the shelters were astir and the hunters crept to the platform and the littluns whimpered as now they so frequently did. Ralph rose obediently, and Piggy, and they went to the platform. \"Talk,\" said Ralph bitterly, \"talk, talk, talk.\"\n","Processing asent: He took the conch from Jack. \"This meeting--\"\n","Processing asent: Jack interrupted him. \"I called it.\" \"If you hadn't called it I should have. You just blew the conch.\" \"Well, isn't that calling it?\" \"Oh, take it! Go on--talk!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph thrust the conch into Jack's arms and sat down on the trunk. \"I've called an assembly,\" said Jack, \"because of a lot of things. First, you know now, we've seen the beast. We crawled up. We were only a few feet away. The beast sat up and looked at us. I don't know what it does. We don't even know what it is--\" \"The beast comes out of the sea--\" \"Out of the dark--\" \"Trees--\" \"Quiet!\" shouted Jack. \"You, listen. The beast is sitting up there, whatever it is--\" \"Perhaps it's waiting--\" \"Hunting--\" \"Yes, hunting.\" \"Hunting,\" said Jack. He remembered his age-old tremors in the forest. \"Yes. The beast is a hunter. Only-- shut up! The next thing is that we couldn't kill it. And the next is that Ralph said my hunters are no good.\" \"I never said that!\" \"I've got the conch. Ralph thinks you're cowards, running away from the boar and the beast. And that's not all.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a kind of sigh on the platform as if everyone knew what was coming. Jack's voice went up, tremulous yet determined, pushing against the uncooperative silence. \"He's like Piggy. He says things like Piggy. He isn't a proper chief.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack clutched the conch to him. \"He's a coward himself.\"\n","Processing asent: For a moment he paused and then went on. \"On top, when Roger and me went on--he stayed back.\" \"I went too!\" \"After.\"\n","Processing asent: The two boys glared at each other through screens of hair. \"I went on too,\" said Ralph, \"then I ran away. So did you.\" \"Call me a coward then.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack turned to the hunters. \"He's not a hunter. He'd never have got us meat. He isn't a prefect and we don't know anything about him. He just gives orders and expects people to obey for nothing. All this talk-- \" \"All this talk!\" shouted Ralph. \"Talk, talk! Who wanted it? Who called the meeting?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack turned, red in the face, his chin sunk back. He glowered up under his eyebrows. \"All right then,\" he said in tones of deep meaning, and menace, \"all right.\"\n","Processing asent: He held the conch against his chest with one hand and stabbed the air with his index finger. \"Who thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?\"\n","Processing asent: He looked expectantly at the boys ranged round, who had frozen. Under the palms there was deadly silence. \"Hands up,\" said Jack strongly, \"whoever wants Ralph not to be chief?\"\n","Processing asent: The silence continued, breathless and heavy and full of shame. Slowly the red drained from Jack's cheeks, then came back with a painful rush. He licked his lips and turned his head at an angle, so that his gaze avoided the embarrassment of linking with another's eye. \"How many think--\"\n","Processing asent: His voice tailed off. The hands that held the conch shook. He cleared his throat, and spoke loudly. \"All right then.\"\n","Processing asent: He laid the conch with great care in the grass at his feet. The humiliating tears were running from the corner of each eye. \"I'm not going to play any longer. Not with you.\"\n","Processing asent: Most of the boys were looking down now, at the grass or their feet. Jack cleared his throat again. \"I'm not going to be a part of Ralph's lot--\"\n","Processing asent: He looked along the right-hand logs, numbering the hunters that had been a choir. \"I'm going off by myself. He can catch his own pigs. Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.\"\n","Processing asent: He blundered out of the triangle toward the drop to the white sand. \"Jack!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack turned and looked back at Ralph. For a moment he paused and then cried out, high-pitched, enraged. \"--No!\"\n","Processing asent: He leapt down from the platform and ran along the beach, paying no heed to the steady fall of his tears; and until he dived into the forest Ralph watched him. Piggy was indignant. \"I been talking, Ralph, and you just stood there like--\"\n","Processing asent: Softly, looking at Piggy and not seeing him, Ralph spoke to himself. \"He'll come back. When the sun goes down he'll come.\"\n","Processing asent: He looked at the conch in Piggy's hand. \"What?\" \"Well there!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy gave up the attempt to rebuke Ralph. He polished his glass again and went back to his subject. \"We can do without Jack Merridew. There's others besides him on this island. But now we really got a beast, though I can't hardly believe it, we'll need to stay close to the platform; there'll be less need of him and his hunting. So now we can really decide on what's what.\" \"There's no help, Piggy. Nothing to be done.\"\n","Processing asent: For a while they sat in depressed silence. Then Simon stood up and took the conch from Piggy, who was so astonished that he remained on his feet. Ralph looked up at Simon. \"Simon? What is it this time?\"\n","Processing asent: A half-sound of jeering ran round the circle and Simon shrank from it. \"I thought there might be something to do. Something we-\"\n","Processing asent: Again the pressure of the assembly took his voice away. He sought for help and sympathy and chose Piggy. He turned half toward him, clutching the conch to his brown chest. \"I think we ought to climb the mountain.\"\n","Processing asent: The circle shivered with dread. Simon broke off and turned to Piggy who was looking at him with an expression of derisive incomprehension. \"What's the good of climbing up to this here beast when Ralph and the other two couldn't do nothing?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon whispered his answer. \"What else is there to do?\"\n","Processing asent: His speech made, he allowed Piggy to lift the conch out of his hands. Then he retired and sat as far away from the others as possible. Piggy was speaking now with more assurance and with what, if the circumstances had not been so serious, the others would have recognized as pleasure. \"I said we could all do without a certain person. Now I say we got to decide on what can be done. And I think I could tell you what Ralph's going to say next. The most important thing on the island is the smoke and you can't have no smoke without a fire.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph made a restless movement. \"No go, Piggy. We've got no fire. That thing sits up there--we'll have to stay here.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy lifted the conch as though to add power to his next words. \"We got no fire on the mountain. But what's wrong with a fire down here? A fire could be built on them rocks. On the sand, even. We'd make smoke just the same.\" \"That's right!\" \"Smoke!\" \"By the bathing pool!\"\n","Processing asent: The boys began to babble. Only Piggy could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain. \"So we'll have the fire down here,\" said Ralph. He looked about him. \"We can build it just here between the bathing pool and the platform. Of course--\"\n","Processing asent: He broke off, frowning, thinking the thing out, unconsciously tugging at the stub of a nail with his teeth. \"Of course the smoke won't show so much, not be seen so far away. But we needn't go near, near the--\"\n","Processing asent: The others nodded in perfect comprehension. There would be no need to go near. \"We'll build the fire now.\"\n","Processing asent: The greatest ideas are the simplest. Now there was something to be done they worked with passion. Piggy was so full of delight and expanding liberty in Jack's departure, so full of pride in his contribution to the good of society, that he helped to fetch wood. The wood he fetched was close at hand, a fallen tree on the platform that they did not need for the assembly, yet to the others the sanctity of the platform had protected even what was useless there. Then the twins realized they would have a fire near them as a comfort in the night and this set a few littluns dancing and clapping hands. The wood was not so dry as the fuel they had used on the mountain. Much of it was damply rotten and full of insects that scurried; logs had to be lifted from the soil with care or they crumbled into sodden powder. More than this, in order to avoid going deep into the forest the boys worked near at hand on any fallen wood no matter how tangled with new growth. The skirts of the forest and the scar were familiar, near the conch and the shelters and sufficiently friendly in daylight. What they might become in darkness nobody cared to think. They worked therefore with great energy and cheerfulness, though as time crept by there was a suggestion of panic in the energy and hysteria in the cheerfulness. They built a pyramid of leaves and twigs, branches and logs, on the bare sand by the platform. For the first time on the island, Piggy himself removed his one glass, knelt down and focused the sun on tinder. Soon there was a ceiling of smoke and a bush of yellow flame. The littluns who had seen few fires since the first catastrophe became wildly excited. They danced and sang and there was a partyish air about the gathering. At last Ralph stopped work and stood up, smudging the sweat from his face with a dirty forearm. \"We'll have to have a small fire. This one's too big to keep up.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy sat down carefully on the sand and began to polish his glass. \"We could experiment. We could find out how to make a small hot fire and then put green branches on to make smoke. Some of them leaves must be better for that than the others.\"\n","Processing asent: As the fire died down so did the excitement. The littluns stopped singing and dancing and drifted away toward the sea or the fruit trees or the shelters. Ralph dropped down in the sand. \"We'll have to make a new list of who's to look after the fire.\" \"If you can find 'em.\"\n","Processing asent: He looked round. Then for the first time he saw how few biguns there were and understood why the work had been so hard. \"Where's Maurice?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy wiped his glass again. \"I expect . . . no, he wouldn't go into the forest by himself, would he?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph jumped up, ran swiftly round the fire and stood by Piggy, holding up his hair. \"But we've got to have a list! There's you and me and Samneric and--\"\n","Processing asent: He would not look at Piggy but spoke casually. \"Where's Bill and Roger?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy leaned forward and put a fragment of wood on the fire. \"I expect they've gone. I expect they won't play either.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph sat down and began to poke little holes in the sand. He was surprised to see that one had a drop of blood by it. He examined his bitten nail closely and watched the little globe of blood that gathered where the quick was gnawed away. Piggy went on speaking. \"I seen them stealing off when we was gathering wood. They went that way. The same way as he went himself.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph finished his inspection and looked up into the air. The sky, as if in sympathy with the great changes among them, was different today and so misty that in some places the hot air seemed white. The disc of the sun was dull silver as though it were nearer and not so hot, yet the air stifled. \"They always been making trouble, haven't they?\"\n","Processing asent: The voice came near his shoulder and sounded anxious. \"We can do without 'em. We'll be happier now, won't we?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph sat. The twins came, dragging a great log and grinning in their triumph. They dumped the log among the embers so that sparks flew. \"We can do all right on our own, can't we?\"\n","Processing asent: For a long time while the log dried, caught fire and turned red hot, Ralph sat in the sand and said nothing. He did not see Piggy go to the twins and whisper to them, nor how the three boys went together into the forest. \"Here you are.\"\n","Processing asent: He came to himself with a jolt. Piggy and the other two were by him. They were laden with fruit. \"I thought perhaps,\" said Piggy, \"we ought to have a feast, kind of.\"\n","Processing asent: The three boys sat down. They had a great mass of the fruit with them and all of it properly ripe. They grinned at Ralph as he took some and began to eat. \"Thanks,\" he said. Then with an accent of pleased surprise--\"Thanks!\" \"Do all right on our own,\" said Piggy. \"It's them that haven't no common sense that make trouble on this island. We'll make a little hot fire--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph remembered what had been worrying him. \"Where's Simon?\" \"I don't know.\" \"You don't think he's climbing the mountain?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy broke into noisy laughter and took more fruit. \"He might be.\"\n","Processing asent: He gulped his mouthful. \"He's cracked.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon had passed through the area of fruit trees but today the littluns had been too busy with the fire on the beach and they had not pursued him there. He went on among the creepers until he reached the great mat that was woven by the open space and crawled inside. Beyond the screen of leaves the sunlight pelted down and the butterflies danced in the middle their unending dance. He knelt down and the arrow of the sun fell on him. That other time the air had seemed to vibrate with heat; but now it threatened. Soon the sweat was running from his long coarse hair. He shifted restlessly but there was no avoiding the sun. Presently he was thirsty, and then very thirsty. He continued to sit. Far off along the beach, Jack was standing before a small group of boys. He was looking brilliantly happy. \"Hunting,\" he said. He sized them up. Each of them wore the remains of a black cap and ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels. \"We'll hunt. I'm going to be chief.\"\n","Processing asent: They nodded, and the crisis passed easily. \"And then--about the beast.\"\n","Processing asent: They moved, looked at the forest. \"I say this. We aren't going to bother about the beast.\"\n","Processing asent: He nodded at them. \"We're going to forget the beast.\" \"That's right!\" \"Yes!\" \"Forget the beast!\"\n","Processing asent: If Jack was astonished by their fervor he did not show it. \"And another thing. We shan't dream so much down here. This is near the end of the island.\"\n","Processing asent: They agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives. \"Now listen. We might go later to the castle rock. But now I'm going to get more of the biguns away from the conch and all that. We'll kill a pig and give a feast.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused and went on more slowly. \"And about the beast. When we kill we'll leave some of the kill for it. Then it won't bother us, maybe.\"\n","Processing asent: He stood up abruptly. \"We'll go into the forest now and hunt.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned and trotted away and after a moment they followed him obediently. They spread out, nervously, in the forest. Almost at once Jack found the dung and scattered roots that told of pig and soon the track was fresh. Jack signaled the rest of the hunt to be quiet and went forward by himself. He was happy and wore the damp darkness of the forest like his old clothes. He crept down a slope to rocks and scattered trees by the sea. The pigs lay, bloated bags of fat, sensuously enjoying the shadows under the trees. There was no wind and they were unsuspicious; and practice had made Jack silent as the shadows. He stole away again and instructed his hidden hunters. Presently they all began to inch forward sweating in the silence and heat. Under the trees an ear flapped idly. A little apart from the rest, sunk in deep maternal bliss, lay the largest sow of the lot. She was black and pink; and the great bladder of her belly was fringed with a row of piglets that slept or burrowed and squeaked. Fifteen yards from the drove Jack stopped, and his arm, straightening, pointed at the sow. He looked round in inquiry to make sure that everyone understood and the other boys nodded at him. The row of right arms slid back. \"Now!\"\n","Processing asent: The drove of pigs started up; and at a range of only ten yards the wooden spears with fire-hardened points flew toward the chosen pig. One piglet, with a demented shriek, rushed into the sea trailing Roger's spear behind it. The sow gave a gasping squeal and staggered up, with two spears sticking in her fat flank. The boys shouted and rushed forward, the piglets scattered and the sow burst the advancing line and went crashing away through the forest. \"After her!\"\n","Processing asent: They raced along the pig-track, but the forest was too dark and tangled so that Jack, cursing, stopped them and cast among the trees. Then he said nothing for a time but breathed fiercely so that they were awed by him and looked at each other in uneasy admiration. Presently he stabbed down at the ground with his finger. \"There--\"\n","Processing asent: Before the others could examine the drop of blood, Jack had swerved off, judging a trace, touching a bough that gave. So he followed, mysteriously right and assured, and the hunters trod behind him. He stopped before a covert. \"In there.\"\n","Processing asent: They surrounded the covert but the sow got away with the sting of another spear in her flank. The trailing butts hindered her and the sharp, cross-cut points were a torment. She blundered into a tree, forcing a spear still deeper; and after that any of the hunters could follow her easily by the drops of vivid blood. The afternoon wore on, hazy and dreadful with damp heat; the sow staggered her way ahead of them, bleeding and mad, and the hunters followed, wedded to her in lust, excited by the long chase and the dropped blood. They could see her now, nearly got up with her, but she spurted with her last strength and held ahead of them again. They were just behind her when she staggered into an open space where bright flowers grew and butterflies danced round each other and the air was hot and still. Here, struck down by the heat, the sow fell and the hunters hurled themselves at her. This dreadful eruption from an unknown world made her frantic; she squealed and bucked and the air was full of sweat and noise and blood and terror. Roger ran round the heap, prodding with his spear whenever pigflesh appeared. Jack was on top of the sow, stabbing downward with his knife. Roger found a lodgment for his point and began to push till he was leaning with his whole weight. The spear moved forward inch by inch and the terrified squealing became a highpitched scream. Then Jack found the throat and the hot blood spouted over his hands. The sow collapsed under them and they were heavy and fulfilled upon her. The butterflies still danced, preoccupied in the center of the clearing. At last the immediacy of the kill subsided. The boys drew back, and Jack stood up, holding out his hands. \"Look.\"\n","Processing asent: He giggled and flicked them while the boys laughed at his reeking palms. Then Jack grabbed Maurice and rubbed the stuff over his cheeks. Roger began to withdraw his spear and boys noticed it for the first time. Robert stabilized the thing in a phrase which was received uproariously. \"Right up her ass!\" \"Did you hear?\" \"Did you hear what he said?\" \"Right up her ass!\"\n","Processing asent: This time Robert and Maurice acted the two parts; and Maurice's acting of the pig's efforts to avoid the advancing spear was so funny that the boys cried with laughter. At length even this palled. Jack began to clean his bloody hands on the rock. Then he started work on the sow and paunched her, lugging out the hot bags of colored guts, pushing them into a pile on the rock while the others watched him. He talked as he worked. \"We'll take the meat along the beach. I'll go back to the platform and invite them to a feast. That should give us time.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger spoke. \"Chief--\" \"Uh--?\" \"How can we make a fire?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack squatted back and frowned at the pig. \"We'll raid them and take fire. There must be four of you; Henry and you, Robert and Maurice. We'll put on paint and sneak up; Roger can snatch a branch while I say what I want. The rest of you can get this back to where we were. We'll build the fire there. And after that-- \" He paused and stood up, looking at the shadows under the trees. His voice was lower when he spoke again. \"But we'll leave part of the kill for . . .\"\n","Processing asent: He knelt down again and was busy with his knife. The boys crowded round him. He spoke over his shoulder to Roger. \"Sharpen a stick at both ends.\"\n","Processing asent: Presently he stood up, holding the dripping sow's head in his hands. \"Where's that stick?\" \"Here.\" \"Ram one end in the earth. Oh--it's rock. Jam it in that crack. There.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack held up the head and jammed the soft throat down on the pointed end of the stick which pierced through into the mouth. He stood back and the head hung there, a little blood dribbling down the stick. Instinctively the boys drew back too; and the forest was very still. They listened, and the loudest noise was the buzzing of flies over the spilled guts. Jack spoke in a whisper. \"Pick up the pig.\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice and Robert skewered the carcass, lifted the dead weight, and stood ready. In the silence, and standing over the dry blood, they looked suddenly furtive. Jack spoke loudly. \"This head is for the beast. It's a gift.\"\n","Processing asent: The silence accepted the gift and awed them. The head remained there, dim-eyed, grinning faintly, blood blackening between the teeth. All at once they were running away, as fast as they could, through the forest toward the open beach. Simon stayed where he was, a small brown image, concealed by the leaves. Even if he shut his eyes the sow's head still remained like an after-image. The half-shut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life. They assured Simon that everything was a bad business. \"I know that.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon discovered that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight, ignoring the flies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick. He looked away, licking his dry lips. A gift for the beast. Might not the beast come for it? The head, he thought, appeared to agree with him. Run away, said the head silently, go back to the others. It was a joke really-- why should you bother? You were just wrong, that's all. A little headache, something you ate, perhaps. Go back, child, said the head silently. Simon looked up, feeling the weight of his wet hair, and gazed at the sky. Up there, for once, were clouds, great bulging towers that sprouted away over the island, grey and cream and copper-colored. The clouds were sitting on the land; they squeezed, produced moment by moment this close, tormenting heat. Even the butterflies deserted the open space where the obscene thing grinned and dripped. Simon lowered his head, carefully keeping his eyes shut, then sheltered them with his hand. There were no shadows under the trees but everywhere a pearly stillness, so that what was real seemed illusive and without definition. The pile of guts was a black blob of flies that buzzed like a saw. After a while these flies found Simon. Gorged, they alighted by his runnels of sweat and drank. They tickled under his nostrils and played leapfrog on his thighs. They were black and iridescent green and without number; and in front of Simon, the Lord of the Flies hung on his stick and grinned. At last Simon gave up and looked back; saw the white teeth and dim eyes, the blood--and his gaze was held by that ancient, inescapable recognition. In Simon's right temple, a pulse began to beat on the brain. Ralph and Piggy lay in the sand, gazing at the fire and idly flicking pebbles into its smokeless heart. \"That branch is gone.\" \"Where's Samneric?\" \"We ought to get some more wood. We're out of green branches.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph sighed and stood up. There were no shadows under the palms on the platform; only this strange light that seemed to come from everywhere at once. High up among the bulging clouds thunder went off like a gun. \"We're going to get buckets of rain.\" \"What about the fire?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph trotted into the forest and returned with a wide spray of green which he dumped on the fire. The branch crackled, the leaves curled and the yellow smoke expanded. Piggy made an aimless little pattern in the sand with his fingers. \"Trouble is, we haven't got enough people for a fire. You got to treat Samnenc as one turn. They do everything together--\" \"Of course.\" \"Well, that isn't fair. Don't you see? They ought to do two turns.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph considered this and understood. He was vexed to find how little he thought like a grownup and sighed again. The island was getting worse and worse. Piggy looked at the fire. \"You'll want another green branch soon.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph rolled over. \"Piggy. What are we going to do?\" \"Just have to get on without 'em.\" \"But--the fire.\"\n","Processing asent: He frowned at the black and white mess in which lay the unburnt ends of branches. He tried to formulate. \"I'm scared.\"\n","Processing asent: He saw Piggy look up; and blundered on. \"Not of the beast. I mean I'm scared of that too. But nobody else understands about the fire. If someone threw you a rope when you were drowning. If a doctor said take this because if you don't take it you'll die--you would, wouldn't you? I mean?\" \"'Course I would.\" \"Can't they see? Can't they understand? Without the smoke signal we'll die here? Look at that!\"\n","Processing asent: A wave of heated air trembled above the ashes but without a trace of smoke. \"We can't keep one fire going. And they don't care. And what's more--\"\n","Processing asent: He looked intensely into Piggy's streaming face. \"What's more, _I_ don't sometimes. Supposing I got like the others--not caring. What 'ud become of us?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy took off his glasses, deeply troubled. \"I dunno, Ralph. We just got to go on, that's all. That's what grownups would do.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph, having begun the business of unburdening himself, continued. \"Piggy, what's wrong?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy looked at him in astonishment. \"Do you mean the--?\" \"No, not it . . . I mean . . . what makes things break up like they do?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy rubbed his glasses slowly and thought. When he understood how far Ralph had gone toward accepting him he flushed pinkly with pride. \"I dunno, Ralph. I expect it's him.\" \"Jack?\" \"Jack.\"\n","Processing asent: A taboo was evolving round that word too. Ralph nodded solemnly. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I suppose it must be.\"\n","Processing asent: The forest near them burst into uproar. Demoniac figures with faces of white and red and green rushed out howling, so that the littluns fled screaming. Out of the corner of his eye, Ralph saw Piggy running. Two figures rushed at the fire and he prepared to defend himself but they grabbed half-burnt branches and raced away along the beach. The three others stood still, watching Ralph; and he saw that the tallest of them, stark naked save for paint and a belt, was Jack. Ralph had his breath back and spoke. \"Well?\"\n","Processing asent: Jack ignored him, lifted his spear and began to shout. \"Listen all of you. Me and my hunters, we're living along the beach by a flat rock. We hunt and feast and have fun. If you want to join my tribe come and see us. Perhaps I'll let you join. Perhaps not.\"\n","Processing asent: He paused and looked round. He was safe from shame or self-consciousness behind the mask of his paint and could look at each of them in turn. Ralph was kneeling by the remains of the fire like a sprinter at his mark and his face was half-hidden by hair and smut. Samneric peered together round a palm tree at the edge of the forest. A littlun howled, creased and crimson, by the bathing pool and Piggy stood on the platform, the white conch gripped in his hands. \"Tonight we're having a feast. We've killed a pig and we've got meat. You can come and eat with us if you like.\"\n","Processing asent: Up in the cloud canyons the thunder boomed again. Jack and the two anonymous savages with him swayed, looking up, and then recovered. The littlun went on howling. Jack was waiting for something. He whispered urgently to the others. \"Go on--now!\"\n","Processing asent: The two savages murmured. Jack spoke sharply. \"Go on!\"\n","Processing asent: The two savages looked at each other, raised their spears together and spoke in time. \"The Chief has spoken.\"\n","Processing asent: Then the three of them turned and trotted away. Presently Ralph rose to his feet, looking at the place where the savages had vanished. Samneric came, talking in an awed whisper. \"I thought it was--\" \"--and I was--\" \"--scared.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy stood above them on the platform, still holding the conch. \"That was Jack and Maurice and Robert,\" said Ralph. \"Aren't they having fun?\" \"I thought I was going to have asthma.\" \"Sucks to your ass-mar.\" \"When I saw Jack I was sure he'd go for the conch. Can't think why.\"\n","Processing asent: The group of boys looked at the white shell with affectionate respect. Piggy placed it in Ralph's hand and the littluns, seeing the familiar symbol, started to come back. \"Not here.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned toward the platform, feeling the need for ritual. First went Ralph, the white conch cradled, then Piggy very grave, then the twins, then the littluns and the others. \"Sit down all of you. They raided us for fire. They're having fun. But the--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph was puzzled by the shutter that flickered in his brain. There was something he wanted to say; then the shutter had come down. \"But the--\"\n","Processing asent: They were regarding him gravely, not yet troubled by any doubts about his sufficiency. Ralph pushed the idiot hair out of his eyes and looked at Piggy. \"But the . . . oh . . . the fire! Of course, the fire!\"\n","Processing asent: He started to laugh, then stopped and became fluent instead. \"The fire's the most important thing. Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning. The fire's the most important thing on the island, because, because--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused again and the silence became full of doubt and wonder. Piggy whispered urgently. \"Rescue.\" \"Oh yes. Without the fire we can't be rescued. So we must stay by the fire and make smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: When he stopped no one said anything. After the many brilliant speeches that had been made on this very spot Ralph's remarks seemed lame, even to the littluns. At last Bill held out his hands for the conch. \"Now we can't have the fire up there--because we can't have the fire up there--we need more people to keep it going. Let's go to this feast and tell them the fire's hard on the rest of us. And the hunting and all that, being savages I mean--it must be jolly good fun.\"\n","Processing asent: Samneric took the conch. \"That must be fun like Bill says--and as he's invited us--\" \"--to a feast--\" \"--meat--\" \"--crackling--\" \"--I could do with some meat--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph held up his hand. \"Why shouldn't we get our own meat?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins looked at each other. Bill answered. \"We don't want to go in the jungle.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph grimaced. \"He--you know--goes.\" \"He's a hunter. They're all hunters. That's different.\"\n","Processing asent: No one spoke for a moment, then Piggy muttered to the sand. \"Meat--\"\n","Processing asent: The littluns sat, solemnly thinking of meat, and dribbling. Overhead the cannon boomed again and the dry palm fronds clattered in a sudden gust of hot wind. \"You are a silly little boy,\" said the Lord of the Flies, \"just an ignorant, silly little boy.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing. \"Don't you agree?\" said the Lord of the Flies. \"Aren't you just a silly little boy?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon answered him in the same silent voice. \"Well then,\" said the Lord of the Flies, \"you'd better run off and play with the others. They think you're batty. You don't want Ralph to think you're batty, do you? You like Ralph a lot, don't you? And Piggy, and Jack?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon's head was tilted slightly up. His eyes could not break away and the Lord of the Flies hung in space before him. \"What are you doing out here all alone? Aren't you afraid of me?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon shook. \"There isn't anyone to help you. Only me. And I'm the Beast.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon's mouth labored, brought forth audible words. \"Pig's head on a stick.\" \"Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!\" said the head. For a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoed with the parody of laughter. \"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go? Why things are what they are?\"\n","Processing asent: The laughter shivered again. \"Come now,\" said the Lord of the Flies. \"Get back to the others and we'll forget the whole thing.\"\n","Processing asent: Simon's head wobbled. His eyes were half closed as though he were imitating the obscene thing on the stick. He knew that one of his times was coming on. The Lord of the Flies was expanding like a balloon. \"This is ridiculous. You know perfectly well you'll only meet me down there--so don't try to escape!\"\n","Processing asent: Simon's body was arched and stiff. The Lord of the Flies spoke in the voice of a schoolmaster. \"This has gone quite far enough. My poor, misguided child, do you think you know better than I do?\"\n","Processing asent: There was a pause. \"I'm warning you. I'm going to get angry. D'you see? You're not wanted. Understand? We are going to have fun on this island. Understand? We are going to have fun on this island! So don't try it on, my poor misguided boy, or else--\"\n","Processing asent: Simon found he was looking into a vast mouth. There was blackness within, a blackness that spread. \"--Or else,\" said the Lord of the Flies, \"we shall do you? See? Jack and Roger and Maurice and Robert and Bill and Piggy and Ralph. Do you. See?\"\n","Processing asent: Simon was inside the mouth. He fell down and lost consciousness. CHAPTER NINE  A View to a Death Over the island the build-up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode. By early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken the place of clear daylight. Even the air that pushed in from the sea was hot and held no refreshment. Colors drained from water and trees and pink surfaces of rock, and the white and brown clouds brooded. Nothing prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the spilt guts look like a heap of glistening coal. Even when the vessel broke in Simon's nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone, preferring the pig's high flavor. With the running of the blood Simon's fit passed into the weariness of sleep. He lay in the mat of creepers while the evening advanced and the cannon continued to play. At last he woke and saw dimly the dark earth close by his cheek. Still he did not move but lay there, his face sideways on the earth, his eyes looking dully before him. Then he turned over, drew his feet under him and laid hold of the creepers to pull himself up. When the creepers shook the flies exploded from the guts with a vicious note and clamped back on again. Simon got to his feet. The light was unearthly. The Lord of the Flies hung on his stick like a black ball. Simon spoke aloud to the clearing. \"What else is there to do?\"\n","Processing asent: Nothing replied. Simon turned away from the open space and crawled through the creepers till he was in the dusk of the forest. He walked drearily between the trunks, his face empty of expression, and the blood was dry round his mouth and chin. Only sometimes as he lifted the ropes of creeper aside and chose his direction from the trend of the land, he mouthed words that did not reach the air. Presently the creepers festooned the trees less frequently and there was a scatter of pearly light from the sky down through the trees. This was the backbone of the island, the slightly higher land that lay beneath the mountain where the forest was no longer deep jungle. Here there were wide spaces interspersed with thickets and huge trees and the trend of the ground led him up as the forest opened. He pushed on, staggering sometimes with his weariness but never stopping. The usual brightness was gone from his eyes and he walked with a sort of glum determination like an old man. A buffet of wind made him stagger and he saw that he was out in the open, on rock, under a brassy sky. He found his legs were weak and his tongue gave him pain all the time. When the wind reached the mountain-top he could see something happen, a flicker of blue stuff against brown clouds. He pushed himself forward and the wind came again, stronger now, cuffing the forest heads till they ducked and roared. Simon saw a humped thing suddenly sit up on the top and look down at him. He hid his face, and toiled on. The flies had found the figure too. The life-like movement would scare them off for a moment so that they made a dark cloud round the head. Then as the blue material of the parachute collapsed the corpulent figure would bow forward, sighing, and the flies settle once more. Simon felt his knees smack the rock. He crawled forward and soon he understood. The tangle of lines showed him the mechanics of this parody; he examined the white nasal bones, the teeth, the colors of corruption. He saw how pitilessly the layers of rubber and canvas held together the poor body that should be rotting away. Then the wind blew again and the figure lifted, bowed, and breathed foully at him. Simon knelt on all fours and was sick till his stomach was empty. Then he took the lines in his hands; he freed them from the rocks and the figure from the wind's indignity. At last he turned away and looked down at the beaches. The fire by the platform appeared to be out, or at least making no smoke. Further along the beach, beyond the little river and near a great slab of rock, a thin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky. Simon, forgetful of the flies, shaded his eyes with both hands and peered at the smoke. Even at that distance it was possible to see that most of the boys--perhaps all of the boys--were there. So they had shifted camp then, away from the beast. As Simon thought this, he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side. The beast was harmless and horrible; and the news must reach the others as soon as possible. He started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him. Even with great care the best he could do was a stagger. \"Bathing,\" said Ralph, \"that's the only thing to do.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy was inspecting the loomingsky through his glass. \"I don't like them clouds. Remember how it rained just after we landed?\" \"Going to rain again.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph dived into the pool. A couple of littluns were playing at the edge, trying to extract comfort from a wetness warmer than blood. Piggy took off his glasses, stepped primly into the water and then put them on again. Ralph came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him. \"Mind my specs,\" said Piggy. \"If I get water on the glass I got to get out and clean 'em.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph squirted again and missed. He laughed at Piggy, expecting him to retire meekly as usual and in pained silence. Instead, Piggy beat the water with his hands. \"Stop it!\" he shouted. \"D'you hear?\"\n","Processing asent: Furiously he drove the water into Ralph's face. \"All right, all right,\" said Ralph. \"Keep your hair on.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy stopped beating the water. \"I got a pain in my head. I wish the air was cooler.\" \"I wish the rain would come.\" \"I wish we could go home.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy lay back against the sloping sand side of the pool. His stomach protruded and the water dried on it. Ralph squinted up at the sky. One could guess at the movement of the sun by the progress of a light patch among the clouds. He knelt in the water and looked round. \"Where's everybody?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy sat up. \"P'raps they're lying in the shelter.\" \"Where's Samneric?\" \"And Bill?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy pointed beyond the platform. \"That's where they've gone. Jack's party.\" \"Let them go,\" said Ralph, uneasily, \"I don't care.\" \"Just for some meat--\" \"And for hunting,\" said Ralph, wisely, \"and for pretending to be a tribe, and putting on war-paint.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy stirred the sand under water and did not look at Ralph. \"P'raps we ought to go too.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him quickly and Piggy blushed. \"I mean--to make sure nothing happens.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph squirted water again. Long before Ralph and Piggy came up with Jack's lot, they could hear the party. There was a stretch of grass in a place where the palms left a wide band of turf between the forest and the shore. Just one step down from the edge of the turf was the white, blown sand of above high water, warm, dry, trodden. Below that again was a rock that stretched away toward the lagoon. Beyond was a short stretch of sand and then the edge of the water. A fire burned on the rock and fat dripped from the roasting pigmeat into the invisible flames. All the boys of the island, except Piggy, Ralph, Simon, and the two tending the pig, were grouped on the turf. They were laughing, singing, lying, squatting, or standing on the grass, holding food in their hands. But to judge by the greasy faces, the meat eating was almost done; and some held coconut shells in their hands and were drinking from them. Before the party had started a great log had been dragged into the center of the lawn and Jack, painted and garlanded, sat there like an idol. There were piles of meat on green leaves near him, and fruit, and coconut shells full of drink. Piggy and Ralph came to the edge of the grassy platform; and the boys, as they noticed them, fell silent one by one till only the boy next to Jack was talking. Then the silence intruded even there and Jack turned where he sat. For a time he looked at them and the crackle of the fire was the loudest noise over the droning of the reef. Ralph looked away; and Sam, thinking that Ralph had turned to him accusingly, put down his gnawed bone with a nervous giggle. Ralph took an uncertain step, pointed to a palm tree, and whispered something inaudible to Piggy; and they both giggled like Sam. Lifting his feet high out of the sand, Ralph started to stroll past. Piggy tried to whistle. At this moment the boys who were cooking at the fire suddenly hauled off a great chunk of meat and ran with it toward the grass. They bumped Piggy, who was burnt, and yelled and danced. Immediately, Ralph and the crowd of boys were united and relieved by a storm of laughter. Piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone felt cheerful and normal. Jack stood up and waved his spear. \"Take them some meat.\"\n","Processing asent: The boys with the spit gave Ralph and Piggy each a succulent chunk. They took the gift, dribbling. So they stood and ate beneath a sky of thunderous brass that rang with the storm-coming. Jack waved his spear again. \"Has everybody eaten as much as they want?\"\n","Processing asent: There was still food left, sizzling on the wooden spits, heaped on the green platters. Betrayed by his stomach, Piggy threw a picked bone down on the beach and stooped for more. Jack spoke again, impatiently. \"Has everybody eaten as much as they want?\"\n","Processing asent: His tone conveyed a warning, given out of the pride of ownership, and the boys ate faster while there was still time. Seeing there was no immediate likelihood of a pause, Jack rose from the log that was his throne and sauntered to the edge of the grass. He looked down from behind his paint at Ralph and Piggy. They moved a little farther off over the sand and Ralph watched the fire as he ate. He noticed, without understanding, how the flames were visible now against the dull light. Evening was come, not with calm beauty but with the threat of violence. Jack spoke. \"Give me a drink.\"\n","Processing asent: Henry brought him a shell and he drank, watching Piggy and Ralph over the jagged rim. Power lay in the brown swell of his forearms: authority sat on his shoulder and chattered in his ear like an ape. \"All sit down.\"\n","Processing asent: The boys ranged themselves in rows on the grass before him but Ralph and Piggy stayed a foot lower, standing on the soft sand. Jack ignored them for the moment, turned his mask down to the seated boys and pointed at them with the spear. \"Who's going to join my tribe?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph made a sudden movement that became a stumble. Some of the boys turned toward him. \"I gave you food,\" said Jack, \"and my hunters will protect you from the beast. Who will join my tribe?\" \"I'm chief,\" said Ralph, \"because you chose me. And we were going to keep the fire going. Now you run after food--\" \"You ran yourself!\" shouted Jack. \"Look at that bone in your hands!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph went crimson. \"I said you were hunters. That was your job.\"\n","Processing asent: Jack ignored him again. \"Who'll join my tribe and have fun?\" \"I'm chief,\" said Ralph tremulously. \"And what about the fire? And I've got the conch-- \" \"You haven't got it with you,\" said Jack, sneering. \"You left it behind. See, clever? And the conch doesn't count at this end of the island--\"\n","Processing asent: All at once the thunder struck. Instead of the dull boom there was a point of impact in the explosion. \"The conch counts here too,\" said Ralph, \"and all over the island.\" \"What are you going to do about it then?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph examined the ranks of boys. There was no help in them and he looked away, confused and sweating. Piggy whispered. \"The fire--rescue.\" \"Who'll join my tribe?\" \"I will.\" \"Me.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll blow the conch,\" said Ralph breathlessly, \"and call an assembly.\" \"We shan't hear it.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy touched Ralph's wrist. \"Come away. There's going to be trouble. And we've had our meat.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a blink of bright light beyond the forest and the thunder exploded again so that a littlun started to whine. Big drops of rain fell among them making individual sounds when they struck. \"Going to be a storm,\" said Ralph, \"and you'll have rain like when we dropped here. Who's clever now? Where are your shelters? What are you going to do about that?\"\n","Processing asent: The hunters were looking uneasily at the sky, flinching from the stroke of the drops. A wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly. The flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming. Jack leapt on to the sand. \"Do our dance! Come on! Dance!\"\n","Processing asent: He ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the pig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_\" The movement became regular while the chant lost its first superficial excitement and began to beat like a steady pulse. Roger ceased to be a pig and became a hunter, so that the center of the ring yawned emptily. Some of the littluns started a ring on their own; and the complementary circles went round and round as though repetition would achieve safety of itself. There was the throb and stamp of a single organism. The dark sky was shattered by a blue-white scar. An instant later the noise was on them like the blow of a gigantic whip. The chant rose a tone in agony. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_\" Now out of the terror rose another desire, thick, urgent, blind. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_\" Again the blue-white scar jagged above them and the sulphurous explosion beat down. The littluns screamed and blundered about, fleeing from the edge of the forest, and one of them broke the ring of biguns in his terror. \"Him! Him!\"\n","Processing asent: The circle became a horseshoe. A thing was crawling out of the forest. It came darkly, uncertainly. The shrill screaming that rose before the beast was like a pain. The beast stumbled into the horseshoe. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_\" The blue-white scar was constant, the noise unendurable. Simon was crying out something about a dead man on a hill. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood! Do him in!_\" The sticks fell and the mouth of the new circle crunched and screamed. The beast was on its knees in the center, its arms folded over its face. It was crying out against the abominable noise something about a body on the hill. The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws. Then the clouds opened and let down the rain like a waterfall. The water bounded from the mountain-top, tore leaves and branches from the trees, poured like a cold shower over the struggling heap on the sand. Presently the heap broke up and figures staggered away. Only the beast lay still, a few yards from the sea. Even in the rain they could see how small a beast it was; and already its blood was staining the sand. Now a great wind blew the rain sideways, cascading the water from the forest trees. On the mountain-top the parachute filled and moved; the figure slid, rose to its feet, spun, swayed down through a vastness of wet air and trod with ungainly feet the tops of the high trees; falling, still falling, it sank toward the beach and the boys rushed screaming into the darkness. The parachute took the figure forward, furrowing the lagoon, and bumped it over the reef and out to sea. Toward midnight the rain ceased and the clouds drifted away, so that the sky was scattered once more with the incredible lamps of stars. Then the breeze died too and there was no noise save the drip and trickle of water that ran out of clefts and spilled down, leaf by leaf, to the brown earth of the island. The air was cool, moist, and clear; and presently even the sound of the water was still. The beast lay huddled on the pale beach and the stains spread, inch by inch. The edge of the lagoon became a streak of phosphorescence which advanced minutely, as the great wave of the tide flowed. The clear water mirrored the clear sky and the angular bright constellations. The line of phosphorescence bulged about the sand grains and little pebbles; it held them each in a dimple of tension, then suddenly accepted them with an inaudible syllable and moved on. Along the shoreward edge of the shallows the advancing clearness was full of strange, moonbeam-bodied creatures with fiery eyes. Here and there a larger pebble clung to its own air and was covered with a coat of pearls. The tide swelled in over the rain-pitted sand and smoothed everything with a layer of silver. Now it touched the first of the stains that seeped from the broken body and the creatures made a moving patch of light as they gathered at the edge. The water rose farther and dressed Simon's coarse hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble. The strange attendant creatures, with their fiery eyes and trailing vapors, busied themselves round his head. The body lifted a fraction of an inch from the sand and a bubble of air escaped from the mouth with a wet plop. Then it turned gently in the water. Somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling, and the film of water on the earth planet was held, bulging slightly on one side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the tide moved farther along the island and the water lifted. Softly, surrounded by a fringe of inquisitive bright creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon's dead body moved out toward the open sea. CHAPTER TEN  The Shell and the Glasses Piggy eyed the advancing figure carefully. Nowadays he sometimes found that he saw more clearly if he removed his glasses and shifted the one lens to the other eye; but even through the good eye, after what had happened, Ralph remained unmistakably Ralph. He came now out of the coconut trees, limping, dirty, with dead leaves hanging from his shock of yellow hair. One eye was a slit in his puffy cheek and a great scab had formed on his right knee. He paused for a moment and peered at the figure on the platform. \"Piggy? Are you the only one left?\" \"There's some littluns.\" \"They don't count. No biguns?\" \"Oh--Samneric. They're collecting wood.\" \"Nobody else?\" \"Not that I know of.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph climbed on to the platform carefully. The coarse grass was still worn away where the assembly used to sit; the fragile white conch still gleamed by the polished seat. Ralph sat down in the grass facing the chief's seat and the conch. Piggy knelt at his left, and for a long minute there was silence. At last Ralph cleared his throat and whispered something. Piggy whispered back. \"What you say?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph spoke up. \"Simon.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy said nothing but nodded, solemnly. They continued to sit, gazing with impaired sight at the chief's seat and the glittering lagoon. The green light and the glossy patches of sunshine played over their befouled bodies. At length Ralph got up and went to the conch. He took the shell caressingly with both hands and knelt, leaning against the trunk. \"Piggy.\" \"Uh?\" \"What we going to do?\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy nodded at the conch. \"You could--\" \"Call an assembly?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph laughed sharply as he said the word and Piggy frowned. \"You're still chief.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph laughed again. \"You are. Over us.\" \"I got the conch.\" \"Ralph! Stop laughing like that. Look, there ain't no need, Ralph! What's the others going to think?\"\n","Processing asent: At last Ralph stopped. He was shivering. \"Piggy.\" \"Uh?\" \"That was Simon.\" \"You said that before.\" \"Piggy.\" \"Uh?\" \"That was murder.\" \"You stop it!\" said Piggy, shrilly. \"What good're you doing talking like that?\"\n","Processing asent: He jumped to his feet and stood over Ralph. \"It was dark. There was that--that bloody dance. There was lightning and thunder and rain. We was scared!\" \"I wasn't scared,\" said Ralph slowly, \"I was--I don't know what I was.\" \"We was scared!\" said Piggy excitedly. \"Anything might have happened. It wasn't--what you said.\"\n","Processing asent: He was gesticulating, searching for a formula. \"Oh, Piggy!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's voice, low and stricken, stopped Piggy's gestures. He bent down and waited. Ralph, cradling the conch, rocked himself to and fro. \"Don't you understand, Piggy? The things we did--\" \"He may still be--\" \"No.\" \"P'raps he was only pretending--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy's voice trailed off at the sight of Ralph's face. \"You were outside. Outside the circle. You never really came in. Didn't you see what we--what they did?\"\n","Processing asent: There was loathing, and at the same time a kind of feverish excitement, in his voice. \"Didn't you see, Piggy?\" \"Not all that well. I only got one eye now. You ought to know that, Ralph.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph continued to rock to and fro. \"It was an accident,\" said Piggy suddenly, \"that's what it was. An accident.\"\n","Processing asent: His voice shrilled again. \"Coming in the dark--he hadn't no business crawling like that out of the dark. He was batty. He asked for it.\"\n","Processing asent: He gesticulated widely again. \"It was an accident.\" \"You didn't see what they did--\" \"Look, Ralph. We got to forget this. We can't do no good thinking about it, see?\" \"I'm frightened. Of us. I want to go home. Oh God, I want to go home.\" \"It was an accident,\" said Piggy stubbornly, \"and that's that.\"\n","Processing asent: He touched Ralph's bare shoulder and Ralph shuddered at the human contact. \"And look, Ralph\"--Piggy glanced round quickly, then leaned close--\"don't let on we was in that dance. Not to Samneric.\" \"But we were! All of us!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy shook his head. \"Not us till last. They never noticed in the dark. Anyway you said I was only on the outside.\" \"So was I,\" muttered Ralph, \"I was on the outside too.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy nodded eagerly. \"That's right. We was on the outside. We never done nothing, we never seen nothing.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy paused, then went on. \"We'll live on our own, the four of us--\" \"Four of us. We aren't enough to keep the fire burning.\" \"We'll try. See? I lit it.\"\n","Processing asent: Samneric came dragging a great log out of the forest. They dumped it by the fire and turned to the pool. Ralph jumped to his feet. \"Hi! You two!\"\n","Processing asent: The twins checked a moment, then walked on. \"They're going to bathe, Ralph.\" \"Better get it over.\"\n","Processing asent: The twins were very surprised to see Ralph. They flushed and looked past him into the air. \"Hullo. Fancy meeting you, Ralph.\" \"We just been in the forest--\" \"--to get wood for the fire--\" \"--we got lost last night.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph examined his toes. \"You got lost after the . . .\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy cleaned his lens. \"After the feast,\" said Sam in a stifled voice. Eric nodded. \"Yes, after the feast.\" \"We left early,\" said Piggy quickly, \"because we were tired.\" \"So did we--\" \"--very early--\" \"--we were very tired.\"\n","Processing asent: Sam touched a scratch on his forehead and then hurriedly took his hand away. Eric fingered his split lip. \"Yes. We were very tired,\" repeated Sam, \"so we left early. Was it a good--\"\n","Processing asent: The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge. Sam twisted and the obscene word shot out of him. \"--dance?\"\n","Processing asent: Memory of the dance that none of them had attended shook all four boys convulsively. \"We left early.\"\n","Processing asent: When Roger came to the neck of land that joined the Castle Rock to the mainland he was not surprised to be challenged. He had reckoned, during the terrible night, on finding at least some of the tribe holding out against the horrors of the island in the safest place. The voice rang out sharply from on high, where the diminishing crags were balanced one on another. \"Halt! Who goes there?\" \"Roger.\" \"Advance, friend.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger advanced. \"You could see who I was.\" \"The chief said we got to challenge everyone.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger peered up. \"You couldn't stop me coming if I wanted.\" \"Couldn't I? Climb up and see.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger clambered up the ladder-like cliff. \"Look at this.\"\n","Processing asent: A log had been jammed under the topmost rock and another lever under that. Robert leaned lightly on the lever and the rock groaned. A full effort would send the rock thundering down to the neck of land. Roger admired. \"He's a proper chief, isn't he?\"\n","Processing asent: Robert nodded. \"He's going to take us hunting.\"\n","Processing asent: He jerked his head in the direction of the distant shelters where a thread of white smoke climbed up the sky. Roger, sitting on the very edge of the cliff, looked somberly back at the island as he worked with his fingers at a loose tooth. His gaze settled on the top of the distant mountain and Robert changed the unspoken subject. \"He's going to beat Wilfred.\" \"What for?\"\n","Processing asent: Robert shook his head doubtfully. \"I don't know. He didn't say. He got angry and made us tie Wilfred up. He's been\"--he giggled excitedly--\"he's been tied for hours, waiting--\" \"But didn't the chief say why?\" \"I never heard him.\"\n","Processing asent: Sitting on the tremendous rock in the torrid sun, Roger received this news as an illumination. He ceased to work at his tooth and sat still, assimilating the possibilities of irresponsible authority. Then, without another word, he climbed down the back of the rocks toward the cave and the rest of the tribe. The chief was sitting there, naked to the waist, his face blocked out in white and red. The tribe lay in a semicircle before him. The newly beaten and untied Wilfred was sniffing noisily in the background. Roger squatted with the rest. \"Tomorrow,\" went on the chief, \"we shall hunt again.\"\n","Processing asent: He pointed at this savage and that with his spear. \"Some of you will stay here to improve the cave and defend the gate. I shall take a few hunters with me and bring back meat. The defenders of the gate will see that the others don't sneak in.\"\n","Processing asent: A savage raised his hand and the chief turned a bleak, painted face toward him. \"Why should they try to sneak in, Chief?\"\n","Processing asent: The chief was vague but earnest. \"They will. They'll try to spoil things we do. So the watchers at the gate must be careful. And then--\"\n","Processing asent: The chief paused. They saw a triangle of startling pink dart out, pass along his lips and vanish again. \"--and then, the beast might try to come in. You remember how he crawled--\"\n","Processing asent: The semicircle shuddered and muttered in agreement. \"He came--disguised. He may come again even though we gave him the head of our kill to eat. So watch; and be careful.\"\n","Processing asent: Stanley lifted his forearm off the rock and held up an interrogative finger. \"Well?\" \"But didn't we, didn't we--?\"\n","Processing asent: He squirmed and looked down. \"No!\"\n","Processing asent: In the silence that followed, each savage flinched away from his individual memory. \"No! How could we--kill--it?\"\n","Processing asent: Half-relieved, half-daunted by the implication of further terrors, the savages murmured again. \"So leave the mountain alone,\" said the chief, solemnly, \"and give it the head if you go hunting.\"\n","Processing asent: Stanley flicked his finger again. \"I expect the beast disguised itself.\" \"Perhaps,\" said the chief. A theological speculation presented itself. \"We'd better keep on the right side of him, anyhow. You can't tell what he might do.\"\n","Processing asent: The tribe considered this; and then were shaken, as if by a flow of wind. The chief saw the effect of his words and stood abruptly. \"But tomorrow we'll hunt and when we've got meat we'll have a feast--\"\n","Processing asent: Bill put up his hand. \"Chief.\" \"Yes?\" \"What'll we use for lighting the fire?\"\n","Processing asent: The chief's blush was hidden by the white and red clay. Into his uncertain silence the tribe spilled their murmur once more. Then the chief held up his hand. \"We shall take fire from the others. Listen. Tomorrow we'll hunt and get meat. Tonight I'll go along with two hunters--who'll come?\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice and Roger put up their hands. \"Maurice--\" \"Yes, Chief?\" \"Where was their fire?\" \"Back at the old place by the fire rock.\"\n","Processing asent: The chief nodded. \"The rest of you can go to sleep as soon as the sun sets. But us three, Maurice, Roger and me, we've got work to do. We'll leave just before sunset--\"\n","Processing asent: Maurice put up his hand. \"But what happens if we meet--\"\n","Processing asent: The chief waved his objection aside. \"We'll keep along by the sands. Then if he comes we'll do our, our dance again.\" \"Only the three of us?\"\n","Processing asent: Again the murmur swelled and died away. Piggy handed Ralph his glasses and waited to receive back his sight. The wood was damp; and this was the third time they had lighted it. Ralph stood back, speaking to himself. \"We don't want another night without fire.\"\n","Processing asent: He looked round guiltily at the three boys standing by. This was the first time he had admitted the double function of the fire. Certainly one was to send up a beckoning column of smoke; but the other was to be a hearth now and a comfort until they slept. Eric breathed on the wood till it glowed and sent out a little flame. A billow of white and yellow smoke reeked up. Piggy took back his glasses and looked at the smoke with pleasure. \"If only we could make a radio!\" \"Or a plane--\" \"--or a boat.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph dredged in his fading knowledge of the world. \"We might get taken prisoner by the Reds.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric pushed back his hair. \"They'd be better than--\"\n","Processing asent: He would not name people and Sam finished the sentence for him by nodding along the beach. Ralph remembered the ungainly figure on a parachute. \"He said something about a dead man.\"\n","Processing asent: He flushed painfully at this admission that he had been present at the dance. He made urging motions at the smoke and with his body. \"Don't stop--go on up!\" \"Smoke's getting thinner.\" \"We need more wood already, even when it's wet.\" \"My asthma--\"\n","Processing asent: The response was mechanical. \"Sucks to your ass-mar.\" \"If I pull logs, I get my asthma bad. I wish I didn't, Ralph, but there it is.\"\n","Processing asent: The three boys went into the forest and fetched armfuls of rotten wood. Once more the smoke rose, yellow and thick. \"Let's get something to eat.\"\n","Processing asent: Together they went to the fruit trees, carrying their spears, saying little, cramming in haste. When they came out of the forest again the sun was setting and only embers glowed in the fire, and there was no smoke. \"I can't carry any more wood,\" said Eric. \"I'm tired.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph cleared his throat. \"We kept the fire going up there.\" \"Up there it was small. But this has got to be a big one.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph carried a fragment to the fire and watched the smoke that drifted into the dusk. \"We've got to keep it going.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric flung himself down. \"I'm too tired. And what's the good?\" \"Eric!\" cried Ralph in a shocked voice. \"Don't talk like that!\"\n","Processing asent: Sam knelt by Eric. \"Well--what is the good?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph tried indignantly to remember. There was something good about a fire. Something overwhelmingly good. \"Ralph's told you often enough,\" said Piggy moodily. \"How else are we going to be rescued?\" \"Of course! If we don't make smoke--\"\n","Processing asent: He squatted before them in the crowding dusk. \"Don't you understand? What's the good of wishing for radios and boats?\"\n","Processing asent: He held out his hand and twisted the fingers into a fist. \"There's only one thing we can do to get out of this mess. Anyone can play at hunting, anyone can get us meat--\"\n","Processing asent: He looked from face to face. Then, at the moment of greatest passion and conviction, that curtain flapped in his head and he forgot what he had been driving at. He knelt there, his fist clenched, gazing solemnly from one to the other. Then the curtain whisked back. \"Oh, yes. So we've got to make smoke; and more smoke--\" \"But we can't keep it going! Look at that!\"\n","Processing asent: The fire was dying on them. \"Two to mind the fire,\" said Ralph, half to himself, \"that's twelve hours a day.\" \"We can't get any more wood, Ralph--\" \"--not in the dark--\" \"--not at night--\" \"We can light it every morning,\" said Piggy. \"Nobody ain't going to see smoke in the dark.\"\n","Processing asent: Sam nodded vigorously. \"It was different when the fire was--\" \"--up there.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood up, feeling curiously defenseless with the darkness pressing in. \"Let the fire go then, for tonight.\"\n","Processing asent: He led the way to the first shelter, which still stood, though battered. The bed leaves lay within, dry and noisy to the touch. In the next shelter a littlun was talking in his sleep. The four biguns crept into the shelter and burrowed under the leaves. The twins lay together and Ralph and Piggy at the other end. For a while there was the continual creak and rustle of leaves as they tried for comfort. \"Piggy.\" \"Yeah?\" \"All right?\" \"S'pose so.\"\n","Processing asent: At length, save for an occasional rustle, the shelter was silent. An oblong of blackness relieved with brilliant spangles hung before them and there was the hollow sound of surf on the reef. Ralph settled himself for his nightly game of supposing. . . . Supposing they could be transported home by jet, then before morning they would land at that big airfield in Wiltshire. They would go by car; no, for things to be perfect they would go by train; all the way down to Devon and take that cottage again. Then at the foot of the garden the wild ponies would come and look over the wall. . . . Ralph turned restlessly in the leaves. Dartmoor was wild and so were the ponies. But the attraction of wildness had gone. His mind skated to a consideration of a tamed town where savagery could not set foot. What could be safer than the bus center with its lamps and wheels? All at once, Ralph was dancing round a lamp standard. There was a bus crawling out of the bus station, a strange bus. . . . \"Ralph! Ralph!\" \"What is it?\" \"Don't make a noise like that--\" \"Sorry.\"\n","Processing asent: From the darkness of the further end of the shelter came a dreadful moaning and they shattered the leaves in their fear. Sam and Eric, locked in an embrace, were fighting each other. \"Sam! Sam!\" \"Hey--Eric!\"\n","Processing asent: Presently all was quiet again. Piggy spoke softly to Ralph. \"We got to get out of this.\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"Get rescued.\"\n","Processing asent: For the first time that day, and despite the crowding blackness, Ralph sniggered. \"I mean it,\" whispered Piggy. \"If we don't get home soon we'll be barmy.\" \"Round the bend.\" \"Bomb happy.\" \"Crackers;\" Ralph pushed the damp tendrils of hair out of his eyes. \"You write a letter to your auntie.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy considered this solemnly. \"I don't know where she is now. And I haven't got an envelope and a stamp. An' there isn't a mailbox. Or a postman.\"\n","Processing asent: The success of his tiny joke overcame Ralph. His sniggers became uncontrollable, his body jumped and twitched. Piggy rebuked him with dignity. \"I haven't said anything all that funny.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph continued to snigger though his chest hurt. His twitchings exhausted him till he lay, breathless and woebegone, waiting for the next spasm. During one of these pauses he was ambushed by sleep. \"Ralph! You been making a noise again. Do be quiet, Ralph--because.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph heaved over among the leaves.\n","Processing asent: He had reason to be thankful that his dream was broken, for the bus had been nearer and more distinct.\n","Processing asent: \"Why--because?\" \"Be quiet--and listen.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph lay down carefully, to the accompaniment of a long sigh from the leaves.\n","Processing asent: Eric moaned something and then lay still.\n","Processing asent: The darkness, save for the useless oblong of stars, was blanket-thick.\n","Processing asent: \"I can't hear anything.\" \"There's something moving outside.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's head prickled.\n","Processing asent: The sound of his blood drowned all else and then subsided.\n","Processing asent: \"I still can't hear anything.\" \"Listen. Listen for a long time.\"\n","Processing asent: Quite clearly and emphatically, and only a yard or so away from the back of the shelter, a stick cracked.\n","Processing asent: The blood roared again in Ralph's ears, confused images chased each other through his mind.\n","Processing asent: A composite of these things was prowling round the shelters.\n","Processing asent: He could feel Piggy's head against his shoulder and the convulsive grip of a hand.\n","Processing asent: \"Ralph! Ralph!\" \"Shut up and listen.\"\n","Processing asent: Desperately, Ralph prayed that the beast would prefer littluns.\n","Processing asent: A voice whispered horribly outside.\n","Processing asent: \"Piggy--Piggy--\" \"It's come!\" gasped Piggy.\n","Processing asent: \"It's real!\"\n","Processing asent: He clung to Ralph and reached to get his breath.\n","Processing asent: \"Piggy, come outside. I want you, Piggy.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's mouth was against Piggy's ear.\n","Processing asent: \"Don't say anything.\" \"Piggy--where are you, Piggy?\"\n","Processing asent: Something brushed against the back of the shelter. Piggy kept still for a moment, then he had his asthma. He arched his back and crashed among the leaves with his legs. Ralph rolled away from him. Then there was a vicious snarling in the mouth of the shelter and the plunge and thump of living things. Someone tripped over Ralph and Piggy's corner became a complication of snarls and crashes and flying limbs. Ralph hit out; then he and what seemed like a dozen others were rolling over and over, hitting, biting, scratching. He was torn and jolted, found fingers in his mouth and bit them. A fist withdrew and came back like a piston, so that the whole shelter exploded into light. Ralph twisted sideways on top of a writhing body and felt hot breath on his cheek. He began to pound the mouth below him, using his clenched fist as a hammer; he hit with more and more passionate hysteria as the face became slippery. A knee jerked up between his legs and he fell sideways, busying himself with his pain, and the fight rolled over him. Then the shelter collapsed with smothering finality; and the anonymous shapes fought their way out and through. Dark figures drew themselves out of the wreckage and flitted away, till the screams of the littluns and Piggy's gasps were once more audible. Ralph called out in a quavering voice. \"All you littluns, go to sleep. We've had a fight with the others. Now go to sleep.\"\n","Processing asent: Samneric came close and peered at Ralph. \"Are you two all right?\" \"I think so--\" \"--I got busted.\" \"So did I. How's Piggy?\"\n","Processing asent: They hauled Piggy clear of the wreckage and leaned him against a tree. The night was cool and purged of immediate terror. Piggy's breathing was a little easier. \"Did you get hurt, Piggy?\" \"Not much.\" \"That was Jack and his hunters,\" said Ralph bitterly. \"Why can't they leave us alone?\" \"We gave them something to think about,\" said Sam. Honesty compelled him to go on. \"At least you did. I got mixed up with myself in a corner.\" \"I gave one of 'em what for,\" said Ralph, \"I smashed him up all right. He won't want to come and fight us again in a hurry.\" \"So did I,\" said Eric. \"When I woke up one was kicking me in the face. I got an awful bloody face, I think, Ralph. But I did him in the end.\" \"What did you do?\" \"I got my knee up,\" said Eric with simple pride, \"and I hit him with it in the pills. You should have heard him holler! He won't come back in a hurry either. So we didn't do too badly.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph moved suddenly in the dark; but then he heard Eric working his mouth. \"What's the matter?\" \"Jus' a tooth loose.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy drew up his legs. \"You all right, Piggy?\" \"I thought they wanted the conch.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph trotted down the pale beach and jumped on to the platform. The conch still glimmered by the chief's seat. He gazed for a moment or two, then went back to Piggy. \"They didn't take the conch.\" \"I know. They didn't come for the conch. They came for something else. Ralph--what am I going to do?\"\n","Processing asent: Far off along the bowstave of beach, three figures trotted toward the Castle Rock.\n","Processing asent: They kept away from the forest and down by the water.\n","Processing asent: Occasionally they sang softly; occasionally they turned cartwheels down by the moving streak of phosphorescence.\n","Processing asent: The chief led then, trotting steadily, exulting in his achievement.\n","Processing asent: He was a chief now in truth; and he made stabbing motions with his spear.\n","Processing asent: From his left hand dangled Piggy's broken glasses.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER ELEVEN  Castle Rock In the short chill of dawn the four boys gathered round the black smudge where the fire had been, while Ralph knelt and blew.\n","Processing asent: Grey, feathery ashes scurried hither and thither at his breath but no spark shone among them.\n","Processing asent: The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.\n","Processing asent: Ralph continued to blow till his ears were singing with the effort, but then the first breeze of dawn took the job off his hands and blinded him with ashes.\n","Processing asent: He squatted back, swore, and rubbed water out of his eyes.\n","Processing asent: \"No use.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric looked down at him through a mask of dried blood.\n","Processing asent: Piggy peered in the general direction of Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \" 'Course it's no use, Ralph. Now we got no fire.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph brought his face within a couple of feet of Piggy's. \"Can you see me?\" \"A bit.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph allowed the swollen flap of his cheek to close his eye again. \"They've got our fire.\"\n","Processing asent: Rage shrilled his voice. \"They stole it!\" \"That's them,\" said Piggy. \"They blinded me. See? That's Jack Merridew. You call an assembly, Ralph, we got to decide what to do.\" \"An assembly for only us?\" \"It's all we got. Sam--let me hold on to you.\"\n","Processing asent: They went toward the platform. \"Blow the conch,\" said Piggy. \"Blow as loud as you can.\"\n","Processing asent: The forests re-echoed; and birds lifted, crying out of the treetops, as on that first morning ages ago. Both ways the beach was deserted. Some littluns came from the shelters. Ralph sat down on the polished trunk and the three others stood before him. He nodded, and Samneric sat down on the right. Ralph pushed the conch into Piggy's hands. He held the shining thing carefully and blinked at Ralph. \"Go on, then.\" \"I just take the conch to say this. I can't see no more and I got to get my glasses back. Awful things has been done on this island. I voted for you for chief. He's the only one who ever got anything done. So now you speak, Ralph, and tell us what. Or else--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy broke off, sniveling. Ralph took back the conch as he sat down. \"Just an ordinary fire. You'd think we could do that, wouldn't you? Just a smoke signal so we can be rescued. Are we savages or what? Only now there's no signal going up. Ships may be passing. Do you remember how he went hunting and the fire went out and a ship passed by? And they all think he's best as chief. Then there was, there was . . . that's his fault, too. If it hadn't been for him it would never have happened. Now Piggy can't see, and they came, stealing--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's voice ran up \"--at night, in darkness, and stole our fire. They stole it. We'd have given them fire if they'd asked. But they stole it and the signal's out and we can't ever be rescued. Don't you see what I mean? We'd have given them fire for themselves only they stole it. I--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused lamely as the curtain flickered in his brain. Piggy held out his hands for the conch. \"What you goin' to do, Ralph? This is jus' talk without deciding. I want my glasses.\" \"I'm trying to think. Supposing we go, looking like we used to, washed and hair brushed--after all we aren't savages really and being rescued isn't a game--\"\n","Processing asent: He opened the flap of his cheek and looked at the twins.\n","Processing asent: \"We could smarten up a bit and then go--\" \"We ought to take spears,\" said Sam. \"Even Piggy.\" \"--because we may need them.\" \"You haven't got the conch!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy held up the shell.\n","Processing asent: \"You can take spears if you want but I shan't. What's the good? I'll have to be led like a dog, anyhow. Yes, laugh. Go on, laugh. There's them on this island as would laugh at anything. And what happened? What's grownups goin' to think? Young Simon was murdered. And there was that other kid what had a mark on his face. Who's seen him since we first come here?\" \"Piggy! Stop a minute!\" \"I got the conch. I'm going to that Jack Merridew an' tell him, I am.\" \"You'll get hurt.\" \"What can he do more than he has? I'll tell him what's what. You let me carry the conch, Ralph. I'll show him the one thing he hasn't got.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy paused for a moment and peered round at the dim figures.\n","Processing asent: The shape of the old assembly, trodden in the grass, listened to him.\n","Processing asent: \"I'm going to him with this conch in my hands. I'm going to hold it out. Look, I'm goin' to say, you're stronger than I am and you haven't got asthma. You can see, I'm goin' to say, and with both eyes. But I don't ask for my glasses back, not as a favor. I don't ask you to be a sport, I'll say, not because you're strong, but because what's right's right. Give me my glasses, I'm going to say--you got to!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy ended, flushed and trembling. He pushed the conch quickly into Ralph's hands as though in a hurry to be rid of it and wiped the tears from his eyes. The green light was gentle about them and the conch lay at Ralph's feet, fragile and white. A single drop of water that had escaped Piggy's fingers now flashed on the delicate curve like a star. At last Ralph sat up straight and drew back his hair. \"All right. I mean--you can try if you like. We'll go with you.\" \"He'll be painted,\" said Sam, timidly.\n","Processing asent: \"You know how he'll be--\" \"--he won't think much of us--\" \"--if he gets waxy we've had it--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph scowled at Sam. Dimly he remembered something Simon had said to him once, by the rocks. \"Don't be silly,\" he said. And then he added quickly, \"Let's go.\"\n","Processing asent: He held out the conch to Piggy who flushed, this time with pride. \"You must carry it.\" \"When we're ready I'll carry it--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy sought in his mind for words to convey his passionate willingness to carry the conch against all odds.\n","Processing asent: \"I don't mind. I'll be glad, Ralph, only I'll have to be led.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph put the conch back on the shining log.\n","Processing asent: \"We better eat and then get ready.\"\n","Processing asent: They made their way to the devastated fruit trees.\n","Processing asent: Piggy was helped to his food and found some by touch.\n","Processing asent: While they ate, Ralph thought of the afternoon.\n","Processing asent: \"We'll be like we were. We'll wash--\"\n","Processing asent: Sam gulped down a mouthful and protested. \"But we bathe every day!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at the filthy objects before him and sighed. \"We ought to comb our hair. Only it's too long.\" \"I've got both socks left in the shelter,\" said Eric, \"so we could pull them over our heads like caps, sort of.\" \"We could find some stuff,\" said Piggy, \"and tie your hair back.\" \"Like a girl!\" \"No. 'Course not.\" \"Then we must go as we are,\" said Ralph, \"and they won't be any better.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric made a detaining gesture. \"But they'll be painted! You know how it is.\"\n","Processing asent: The others nodded. They understood only too well the liberation into savagery that the concealing paint brought. \"Well, we won't be painted,\" said Ralph, \"because we aren't savages.\"\n","Processing asent: Samneric looked at each other. \"All the same--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shouted. \"No paint!\"\n","Processing asent: He tried to remember. \"Smoke,\" he said, \"we want smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: He turned on the twins fiercely. \"I said 'smoke'! We've got to have smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: There was silence, except for the multitudinous murmur of the bees.\n","Processing asent: As last Piggy spoke, kindly.\n","Processing asent: \" 'Course we have. 'Cos the smoke's a signal and we can't be rescued if we don't have smoke.\" \"I knew that!\" shouted Ralph. He pulled his arm away from Piggy. \"Are you suggesting- -?\" \"I'm jus' saying what you always say,\" said Piggy hastily.\n","Processing asent: \"I'd thought for a moment--\" \"I hadn't,\" said Ralph loudly.\n","Processing asent: \"I knew it all the time. I hadn't forgotten.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy nodded propitiatingly.\n","Processing asent: \"You're chief, Ralph. You remember everything.\" \"I hadn't forgotten.\" \" 'Course not.\"\n","Processing asent: The twins were examining Ralph curiously, as though they were seeing him for the first time. They set off along the beach in formation. Ralph went first, limping a little, his spear carried over one shoulder. He saw things partially, through the tremble of the heat haze over the flashing sands, and his own long hair and injuries. Behind him came the twins, worried now for a while but full of unquenchable vitality. They said little but trailed the butts of their wooden spears; for Piggy had found that, by looking down and shielding his tired sight from the sun, he could just see these moving along the sand. He walked between the trailing butts, therefore, the conch held carefully between his two hands. The boys made a compact little group that moved over the beach, four plate-like shadows dancing and mingling beneath them. There was no sign left of the storm, and the beach was swept clean like a blade that has been scoured. The sky and the mountain were at an immense distance, shimmering in the heat; and the reef was lifted by mirage, floating in a kind of silver pool halfway up the sky. They passed the place where the tribe had danced. The charred sticks still lay on the rocks where the rain had quenched them but the sand by the water was smooth again. They passed this in silence. No one doubted that the tribe would be found at the Castle Rock and when they came in sight of it they stopped with one accord. The densest tangle on the island, a mass of twisted stems, black and green and impenetrable, lay on their left and tall grass swayed before them. Now Ralph went forward. Here was the crushed grass where they had all lain when he had gone to prospect. There was the neck of land, the ledge skirting the rock, up there were the red pinnacles. Sam touched his arm. \"Smoke.\"\n","Processing asent: There was a tiny smudge of smoke wavering into the air on the other side of the rock. \"Some fire--I don't think.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph turned. \"What are we hiding for?\"\n","Processing asent: He stepped through the screen of grass on to the little open space that led to the narrow neck. \"You two follow behind. I'll go first, then Piggy a pace behind me. Keep your spears ready.\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy peered anxiously into the luminous veil that hung between him and the world. \"Is it safe? Ain't there a cliff? I can hear the sea.\" \"You keep right close to me.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph moved forward on to the neck. He kicked a stone and it bounded into the water. Then the sea sucked down, revealing a red, weedy square forty feet beneath Ralph's left arm. \"Am I safe?\" quavered Piggy. \"I feel awful--\"\n","Processing asent: High above them from the pinnacles came a sudden shout and then an imitation warcry that was answered by a dozen voices from behind the rock. \"Give me the conch and stay still.\" \"Halt! Who goes there?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph bent back his head and glimpsed Roger's dark face at the top. \"You can see who I am!\" he shouted. \"Stop being silly!\"\n","Processing asent: He put the conch to his lips and began to blow. Savages appeared, painted out of recognition, edging round the ledge toward the neck. They carried spears and disposed themselves to defend the entrance. Ralph went on blowing and ignored Piggy's terrors. Roger was shouting. \"You mind out--see?\"\n","Processing asent: At length Ralph took his lips away and paused to get his breath back. His first words were a gasp, but audible. \"--calling an assembly.\"\n","Processing asent: The savages guarding the neck muttered among themselves but made no motion. Ralph walked forwards a couple of steps. A voice whispered urgently behind him. \"Don't leave me, Ralph.\" \"You kneel down,\" said Ralph sideways, \"and wait till I come back.\"\n","Processing asent: He stood halfway along the neck and gazed at the savages intently. Freed by the paint, they had tied their hair back and were more comfortable than he was. Ralph made a resolution to tie his own back afterwards. Indeed he felt like telling them to wait and doing it there and then; but that was impossible. The savages sniggered a bit and one gestured at Ralph with his spear. High above, Roger took his hands off the lever and leaned out to see what was going on. The boys on the neck stood in a pool of their own shadow, diminished to shaggy heads. Piggy crouched, his back shapeless as a sack. \"I'm calling an assembly.\"\n","Processing asent: Silence. Roger took up a small stone and flung it between the twins, aiming to miss. They started and Sam only just kept his footing. Some source of power began to pulse in Roger's body. Ralph spoke again, loudly. \"I'm calling an assembly.\"\n","Processing asent: He ran his eye over them. \"Where's Jack?\"\n","Processing asent: The group of boys stirred and consulted. A painted face spoke with the voice of Robert. \"He's hunting. And he said we weren't to let you in.\" \"I've come to see about the fire,\" said Ralph, \"and about Piggy's specs.\"\n","Processing asent: The group in front of him shifted and laughter shivered outwards from among them, light, excited laughter that went echoing among the tall rocks. A voice spoke from behind Ralph. \"What do you want?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins made a bolt past Ralph and got between him and the entry. He turned quickly. Jack, identifiable by personality and red hair, was advancing from the forest. A hunter crouched on either side. All three were masked in black and green. Behind them on the grass the headless and paunched body of a sow lay where they had dropped it. Piggy wailed. \"Ralph! Don't leave me!\"\n","Processing asent: With ludicrous care he embraced the rock, pressing himself to it above the sucking sea. The sniggering of the savages became a loud derisive jeer. Jack shouted above the noise. \"You go away, Ralph. You keep to your end. This is my end and my tribe. You leave me alone.\"\n","Processing asent: The jeering died away. \"You pinched Piggy's specs,\" said Ralph, breathlessly. \"You've got to give them back.\" \"Got to? Who says?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph's temper blazed out. \"I say! You voted for me for chief. Didn't you hear the conch? You played a dirty trick- -we'd have given you fire if you'd asked for it--\"\n","Processing asent: The blood was flowing in his cheeks and the bunged-up eye throbbed. \"You could have had fire whenever you wanted. But you didn't. You came sneaking up like a thief and stole Piggy's glasses!\" \"Say that again!\" \"Thief! Thief!\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy screamed. \"Ralph! Mind me!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack made a rush and stabbed at Ralph's chest with his spear. Ralph sensed the position of the weapon from the glimpse he caught of Jack's arm and put the thrust aside with his own butt. Then he brought the end round and caught Jack a stinger across the ear. They were chest to chest, breathing fiercely, pushing and glaring. \"Who's a thief?\" \"You are!\"\n","Processing asent: Jack wrenched free and swung at Ralph with his spear. By common consent they were using the spears as sabers now, no longer daring the lethal points. The blow struck Ralph's spear and slid down, to fall agonizingly on his fingers. Then they were apart once more, their positions reversed, Jack toward the Castle Rock and Ralph on the outside toward the island. Both boys were breathing very heavily. \"Come on then--\" \"Come on--\"\n","Processing asent: Truculently they squared up to each other but kept just out of fighting distance. \"You come on and see what you get!\" \"You come on--\"\n","Processing asent: Piggy clutching the ground was trying to attract Ralph's attention. Ralph moved, bent down, kept a wary eye on Jack. \"Ralph--remember what we came for. The fire. My specs.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph nodded. He relaxed his fighting muscles, stood easily and grounded the butt of his spear. Jack watched him inscrutably through his paint. Ralph glanced up at the pinnacles, then toward the group of savages. \"Listen. We've come to say this. First you've got to give back Piggy's specs. If he hasn't got them he can't see. You aren't playing the game--\"\n","Processing asent: The tribe of painted savages giggled and Ralph's mind faltered. He pushed his hair up and gazed at the green and black mask before him, trying to remember what Jack looked like. Piggy whispered. \"And the fire.\" \"Oh yes. Then about the fire. I say this again. I've been saying it ever since we dropped in.\"\n","Processing asent: He held out his spear and pointed at the savages. \"Your only hope is keeping a signal fire going as long as there's light to see. Then maybe a ship'll notice the smoke and come and rescue us and take us home. But without that smoke we've got to wait till some ship comes by accident. We might wait years; till we were old--\"\n","Processing asent: The shivering, silvery, unreal laughter of the savages sprayed out and echoed away. A gust of rage shook Ralph. His voice cracked. \"Don't you understand, you painted fools? Sam, Eric, Piggy and me--we aren't enough. We tried to keep the fire going, but we couldn't. And then you, playing at hunting. . . .\"\n","Processing asent: He pointed past them to where the trickle of smoke dispersed in the pearly air. \"Look at that! Call that a signal fire? That's a cooking fire. Now you'll eat and there'll be no smoke. Don't you understand? There may be a ship out there--\"\n","Processing asent: He paused, defeated by the silence and the painted anonymity of the group guarding the entry. Jack opened a pink mouth and addressed Samneric, who were between him and his tribe. \"You two. Get back.\"\n","Processing asent: No one answered him. The twins, puzzled, looked at each other; while Piggy, reassured by the cessation of violence, stood up carefully. Jack glanced back at Ralph and then at the twins. \"Grab them!\"\n","Processing asent: No one moved. Jack shouted angrily. \"I said 'grab them'!\"\n","Processing asent: The painted group moved round Samneric nervously and unhandily.\n","Processing asent: Once more the silvery laughter scattered.\n","Processing asent: Samneric protested out of the heart of civilization.\n","Processing asent: \"Oh, I say!\" \"--honestly!\"\n","Processing asent: Their spears were taken from them.\n","Processing asent: \"Tie them up!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph cried out hopelessly against the black and green mask.\n","Processing asent: \"Jack!\" \"Go on. Tie them.\"\n","Processing asent: Now the painted group felt the otherness of Samneric, felt the power in their own hands.\n","Processing asent: They felled the twins clumsily and excitedly.\n","Processing asent: Jack was inspired.\n","Processing asent: He knew that Ralph would attempt a rescue.\n","Processing asent: He struck in a humming circle behind him and Ralph only just parried the blow.\n","Processing asent: Beyond them the tribe and the twins were a loud and writhing heap.\n","Processing asent: Piggy crouched again.\n","Processing asent: Then the twins lay, astonished, and the tribe stood round them.\n","Processing asent: Jack turned to Ralph and spoke between his teeth.\n","Processing asent: \"See? They do what I want.\"\n","Processing asent: There was silence again.\n","Processing asent: The twins lay, inexpertly tied up, and the tribe watched Ralph to see what he would do.\n","Processing asent: He numbered them through his fringe, glimpsed the ineffectual smoke.\n","Processing asent: His temper broke.\n","Processing asent: He screamed at Jack.\n","Processing asent: \"You're a beast and a swine and a bloody, bloody thief!\"\n","Processing asent: He charged.\n","Processing asent: Jack, knowing this was the crisis, charged too.\n","Processing asent: They met with a jolt and bounced apart.\n","Processing asent: Jack swung with his fist at Ralph and caught him on the ear.\n","Processing asent: Ralph hit Jack in the stomach and made him grunt.\n","Processing asent: Then they were facing each other again, panting and furious, but unnerved by each other's ferocity.\n","Processing asent: They became aware of the noise that was the background to this fight, the steady shrill cheering of the tribe behind them.\n","Processing asent: Piggy's voice penetrated to Ralph.\n","Processing asent: \"Let me speak.\"\n","Processing asent: He was standing in the dust of the fight, and as the tribe saw his intention the shrill cheer changed to a steady booing.\n","Processing asent: Piggy held up the conch and the booing sagged a little, then came up again to strength.\n","Processing asent: \"I got the conch!\"\n","Processing asent: He shouted.\n","Processing asent: \"I tell you, I got the conch!\"\n","Processing asent: Surprisingly, there was silence now; the tribe were curious to hear what amusing thing he might have to say.\n","Processing asent: Silence and pause; but in the silence a curious air-noise, close by Ralph's head.\n","Processing asent: He gave it half his attention--and there it was again; a faint \"Zup!\"\n","Processing asent: Someone was throwing stones: Roger was dropping them, his one hand still on the lever. Below him, Ralph was a shock of hair and Piggy a bag of fat. \"I got this to say. You're acting like a crowd of kids.\"\n","Processing asent: The booing rose and died again as Piggy lifted the white, magic shell. \"Which is better--to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is?\"\n","Processing asent: A great clamor rose among the savages.\n","Processing asent: Piggy shouted again.\n","Processing asent: \"Which is better--to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\"\n","Processing asent: Again the clamor and again--\"Zup!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shouted against the noise.\n","Processing asent: \"Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?\"\n","Processing asent: Now Jack was yelling too and Ralph could no longer make himself heard.\n","Processing asent: Jack had backed right against the tribe and they were a solid mass of menace that bristled with spears.\n","Processing asent: The intention of a charge was forming among them; they were working up to it and the neck would be swept clear.\n","Processing asent: Ralph stood facing them, a little to one side, his spear ready.\n","Processing asent: By him stood Piggy still holding out the talisman, the fragile, shining beauty of the shell.\n","Processing asent: The storm of sound beat at them, an incantation of hatred.\n","Processing asent: High overhead, Roger, with a sense of delirious abandonment, leaned all his weight on the lever.\n","Processing asent: Ralph heard the great rock before he saw it.\n","Processing asent: He was aware of a jolt in the earth that came to him through the soles of his feet, and the breaking sound of stones at the top of the cliff.\n","Processing asent: Then the monstrous red thing bounded across the neck and he flung himself flat while the tribe shrieked.\n","Processing asent: The rock struck Piggy a glancing blow from chin to knee; the conch exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist.\n","Processing asent: Piggy, saying nothing, with no time for even a grunt, traveled through the air sideways from the rock, turning over as he went.\n","Processing asent: The rock bounded twice and was lost in the forest.\n","Processing asent: Piggy fell forty feet and landed on his back across the square red rock in the sea.\n","Processing asent: His head opened and stuff came out and turned red.\n","Processing asent: Piggy's arms and legs twitched a bit, like a pig's after it has been killed.\n","Processing asent: Then the sea breathed again in a long, slow sigh, the water boiled white and pink over the rock; and when it went, sucking back again, the body of Piggy was gone.\n","Processing asent: This time the silence was complete.\n","Processing asent: Ralph's lips formed a word but no sound came.\n","Processing asent: Suddenly Jack bounded out from the tribe and began screaming wildly.\n","Processing asent: \"See? See? That's what you'll get! I meant that! There isn't a tribe for you any more! The conch is gone--\"\n","Processing asent: He ran forward, stooping. \"I'm chief!\"\n","Processing asent: Viciously, with full intention, he hurled his spear at Ralph. The point tore the skin and flesh over Ralph's ribs, then sheared off and fell in the water. Ralph stumbled, feeling not pain but panic, and the tribe, screaming now like the chief, began to advance. Another spear, a bent one that would not fly straight, went past his face and one fell from on high where Roger was. The twins lay hidden behind the tribe and the anonymous devils' faces swarmed across the neck. Ralph turned and ran. A great noise as of sea gulls rose behind him. He obeyed an instinct that he did not know he possessed and swerved over the open space so that the spears went wide. He saw the headless body of the sow and jumped in time. Then he was crashing through foliage and small boughs and was hidden by the forest. The chief stopped by the pig, turned and held up his hands. \"Back! Back to the fort!\"\n","Processing asent: Presently the tribe returned noisily to the neck where Roger joined them. The chief spoke to him angrily. \"Why aren't you on watch?\"\n","Processing asent: Roger looked at him gravely. \"I just came down--\"\n","Processing asent: The hangman's horror clung round him.\n","Processing asent: The chief said no more to him but looked down at Samneric.\n","Processing asent: \"You got to join the tribe.\" \"You lemme go--\" \"--and me.\"\n","Processing asent: The chief snatched one of the few spears that were left and poked Sam in the ribs.\n","Processing asent: \"What d'you mean by it, eh?\" said the chief fiercely.\n","Processing asent: \"What d'you mean by coming with spears? What d'you mean by not joining my tribe?\"\n","Processing asent: The prodding became rhythmic.\n","Processing asent: Sam yelled.\n","Processing asent: \"That's not the way.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger edged past the chief, only just avoiding pushing him with his shoulder.\n","Processing asent: The yelling ceased, and Samneric lay looking up in quiet terror.\n","Processing asent: Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.\n","Processing asent: CHAPTER TWELVE  Cry of the Hunters Ralph lay in a covert, wondering about his wounds.\n","Processing asent: The bruised flesh was inches in diameter over his right ribs, with a swollen and bloody scar where the spear had hit him.\n","Processing asent: His hair was full of dirt and tapped like the tendrils of a creeper.\n","Processing asent: All over he was scratched and bruised from his flight through the forest.\n","Processing asent: By the time his breathing was normal again, he had worked out that bathing these injuries would have to wait.\n","Processing asent: How could you listen for naked feet if you were splashing in water?\n","Processing asent: How could you be safe by the little stream or on the open beach?\n","Processing asent: Ralph listened.\n","Processing asent: He was not really far from the Castle Rock, and during the first panic he had thought he heard sounds of pursuit.\n","Processing asent: But the hunters had only sneaked into the fringes of the greenery, retrieving spears perhaps, and then had rushed back to the sunny rock as if terrified of the darkness under the leaves.\n","Processing asent: He had even glimpsed one of them, striped brown, black, and red, and had judged that it was Bill.\n","Processing asent: But really, thought Ralph, this was not Bill.\n","Processing asent: This was a savage whose image refused to blend with that ancient picture of a boy in shorts and shirt.\n","Processing asent: The afternoon died away; the circular spots of sunlight moved steadily over green fronds and brown fiber but no sound came from behind the rock.\n","Processing asent: At last Ralph wormed out of the ferns and sneaked forward to the edge of that impenetrable thicket that fronted the neck of land.\n","Processing asent: He peered with elaborate caution between branches at the edge and could see Robert sitting on guard at the top of the cliff.\n","Processing asent: He held a spear in his left hand and was tossing up a pebble and catching it again with the right.\n","Processing asent: Behind him a column of smoke rose thickly, so that Ralph's nostrils flared and his mouth dribbled.\n","Processing asent: He wiped his nose and mouth with the back of his hand and for the first time since the morning felt hungry.\n","Processing asent: The tribe must be sitting round the gutted pig, watching the fat ooze and burn among the ashes.\n","Processing asent: They would be intent.\n","Processing asent: Another figure, an unrecognizable one, appeared by Robert and gave him something, then turned and went back behind the rock.\n","Processing asent: Robert laid his spear on the rock beside him and began to gnaw between his raised hands.\n","Processing asent: So the feast was beginning and the watchman had been given his portion.\n","Processing asent: Ralph saw that for the time being he was safe.\n","Processing asent: He limped away through the fruit trees, drawn by the thought of the poor food yet bitter when he remembered the feast.\n","Processing asent: Feast today, and then tomorrow.\n","Processing asent: . . . He argued unconvincingly that they would let him alone, perhaps even make an outlaw of him.\n","Processing asent: But then the fatal unreasoning knowledge came to him again.\n","Processing asent: The breaking of the conch and the deaths of Piggy and Simon lay over the island like a vapor.\n","Processing asent: These painted savages would go further and further.\n","Processing asent: Then there was that indefinable connection between himself and Jack; who therefore would never let him alone; never.\n","Processing asent: He paused, sun-flecked, holding up a bough, prepared to duck under it.\n","Processing asent: A spasm of terror set him shaking and he cried aloud.\n","Processing asent: \"No. They're not as bad as that. It was an accident.\"\n","Processing asent: He ducked under the bough, ran clumsily, then stopped and listened.\n","Processing asent: He came to the smashed acres of fruit and ate greedily.\n","Processing asent: He saw two littluns and, not having any idea of his own appearance, wondered why they screamed and ran.\n","Processing asent: When he had eaten he went toward the beach.\n","Processing asent: The sunlight was slanting now into the palms by the wrecked shelter.\n","Processing asent: There was the platform and the pool.\n","Processing asent: The best thing to do was to ignore this leaden feeling about the heart and rely on their common sense, their daylight sanity.\n","Processing asent: Now that the tribe had eaten, the thing to do was to try again.\n","Processing asent: And anyway, he couldn't stay here all night in an empty shelter by the deserted platform.\n","Processing asent: His flesh crept and he shivered in the evening sun.\n","Processing asent: No fire; no smoke; no rescue.\n","Processing asent: He turned and limped away through the forest toward Jack's end of the island.\n","Processing asent: The slanting sticks of sunlight were lost among the branches.\n","Processing asent: At length he came to a clearing in the forest where rock prevented vegetation from growing.\n","Processing asent: Now it was a pool of shadows and Ralph nearly flung himself behind a tree when he saw something standing in the center; but then he saw that the white face was bone and that the pig's skull grinned at him from the top of a stick.\n","Processing asent: He walked slowly into the middle of the clearing and looked steadily at the skull that gleamed as white as ever the conch had done and seemed to jeer at him cynically.\n","Processing asent: An inquisitive ant was busy in one of the eye sockets but otherwise the thing was lifeless.\n","Processing asent: Or was it?\n","Processing asent: Little prickles of sensation ran up and down his back.\n","Processing asent: He stood, the skull about on a level with his face, and held up his hair with two hands.\n","Processing asent: The teeth grinned, the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and without effort.\n","Processing asent: What was it?\n","Processing asent: The skull regarded Ralph like one who knows all the answers and won't tell.\n","Processing asent: A sick fear and rage swept him.\n","Processing asent: Fiercely he hit out at the filthy thing in front of him that bobbed like a toy and came back, still grinning into his face, so that he lashed and cried out in loathing.\n","Processing asent: Then he was licking his bruised knuckles and looking at the bare stick, while the skull lay in two pieces, its grin now six feet across.\n","Processing asent: He wrenched the quivering stick from the crack and held it as a spear between him and the white pieces.\n","Processing asent: Then he backed away, keeping his face to the skull that lay grinning at the sky.\n","Processing asent: When the green glow had gone from the horizon and night was fully accomplished, Ralph came again to the thicket in front of the Castle Rock.\n","Processing asent: Peeping through, he could see that the height was still occupied, and whoever it was up there had a spear at the ready.\n","Processing asent: He knelt among the shadows and felt his isolation bitterly.\n","Processing asent: They were savages it was true; but they were human, and the ambushing fears of the deep night were coming on.\n","Processing asent: Ralph moaned faintly.\n","Processing asent: Tired though he was, he could not relax and fall into a well of sleep for fear of the tribe.\n","Processing asent: Might it not be possible to walk boldly into the fort, say-- \"I've got pax,\" laugh lightly and sleep among the others? Pretend they were still boys, schoolboys who had said, \"Sir, yes, Sir\"--and worn caps?\n","Processing asent: Daylight might have answered yes; but darkness and the horrors of death said no.\n","Processing asent: Lying there in the darkness, he knew he was an outcast.\n","Processing asent: \" 'Cos I had some sense.\"\n","Processing asent: He rubbed his cheek along his forearm, smelling the acrid scent of salt and sweat and the staleness of dirt. Over to the left, the waves of ocean were breathing, sucking down, then boiling back over the rock. There were sounds coming from behind the Castle Rock. Listening carefully, detaching his mind from the swing of the sea, Ralph could make out a familiar rhythm. \"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_\" The tribe was dancing. Somewhere on the other side of this rocky wall there would be a dark circle, a glowing fire, and meat. They would be savoring food and the comfort of safety. A noise nearer at hand made him quiver. Savages were clambering up the Castle Rock, right up to the top, and he could hear voices. He sneaked forward a few yards and saw the shape at the top of the rock change and enlarge. There were only two boys on the island who moved or talked like that. Ralph put his head down on his forearms and accepted this new fact like a wound. Samneric were part of the tribe now. They were guarding the Castle Rock against him. There was no chance of rescuing them and building up an outlaw tribe at the other end of the island. Samneric were savages like the rest; Piggy was dead, and the conch smashed to powder. At length the guard climbed down. The two that remained seemed nothing more than a dark extension of the rock. A star appeared behind them and was momentarily eclipsed by some movement. Ralph edged forward, feeling his way over the uneven surface as though he were blind. There were miles of vague water at his right and the restless ocean lay under his left hand, as awful as the shaft of a pit. Every minute the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of whiteness. Ralph crawled until he found the ledge of the entry in his grasp. The lookouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a spear projecting over the rock. He called very gently. \"Samneric--\"\n","Processing asent: There was no reply. To carry he must speak louder; and this would rouse those striped and inimical creatures from their feasting by the fire. He set his teeth and started to climb, finding the holds by touch. The stick that had supported a skull hampered him but he would not be parted from his only weapon. He was nearly level with the twins before he spoke again. \"Samneric--\"\n","Processing asent: He heard a cry and a flurry from the rock. The twins had grabbed each other and were gibbering. \"It's me. Ralph.\"\n","Processing asent: Terrified that they would run and give the alarm, he hauled himself up until his head and shoulders stuck over the top. Far below his armpit he saw the luminous flowering round the rock. \"It's only me. Ralph.\"\n","Processing asent: At length they bent forward and peered in his face. \"We thought it was--\" \"--we didn't know what it was--\" \"--we thought--\"\n","Processing asent: Memory of their new and shameful loyalty came to them. Eric was silent but Sam tried to do his duty. \"You got to go, Ralph. You go away now--\"\n","Processing asent: He wagged his spear and essayed fierceness. \"You shove off. See?\"\n","Processing asent: Eric nodded agreement and jabbed his spear in the air. Ralph leaned on his arms and did not go. \"I came to see you two.\"\n","Processing asent: His voice was thick. His throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound. \"I came to see you two--\"\n","Processing asent: Words could not express the dull pain of these things. He fell silent, while the vivid stars were spilt and danced all ways. Sam shifted uneasily. \"Honest, Ralph, you'd better go.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked up again. \"You two aren't painted. How can you--? If it were light--\"\n","Processing asent: If it were light shame would burn them at admitting these things. But the night was dark. Eric took up; and then the twins started their antiphonal speech. \"You got to go because it's not safe--\" \"--they made us. They hurt us--\" \"Who? Jack?\" \"Oh no--\"\n","Processing asent: They bent to him and lowered their voices. \"Push off, Ralph--\" \"--it's a tribe--\" \"--they made us--\" \"--we couldn't help it--\"\n","Processing asent: When Ralph spoke again his voice was low, and seemed breathless. \"What have I done? I liked him--and I wanted us to be rescued--\"\n","Processing asent: Again the stars spilled about the sky. Eric shook his head, earnestly. \"Listen, Ralph. Never mind what's sense. That's gone--\" \"Never mind about the chief--\" \"--you got to go for your own good.\" \"The chief and Roger--\" \"--yes, Roger--\" \"They hate you, Ralph. They're going to do you.\" \"They're going to hunt you tomorrow.\" \"But why?\" \"I dunno. And Ralph, Jack, the chief, says it'll be dangerous--\" \"--and we've got to be careful and throw our spears like at a pig.\" \"We're going to spread out in a line across the island--\" \"--we're going forward from this end--\" \"--until we find you.\" \"We've got to give signals like this.\"\n","Processing asent: Eric raised his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on his open mouth. Then he glanced behind him nervously. \"Like that--\" \"--only louder, of course.\" \"But I've done nothing,\" whispered Ralph, urgently. \"I only wanted to keep up a fire!\"\n","Processing asent: He paused for a moment, thinking miserably of the morrow. A matter of overwhelming importance occurred to him. \"What are you--?\"\n","Processing asent: He could not bring himself to be specific at first; but then fear and loneliness goaded him. \"When they find me, what are they going to do?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins were silent. Beneath him, the death rock flowered again. \"What are they--oh God! I'm hungry--\"\n","Processing asent: The towering rock seemed to sway under him. \"Well--what--?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins answered his question indirectly. \"You got to go now, Ralph.\" \"For your own good.\" \"Keep away. As far as you can.\" \"Won't you come with me? Three of us--we'd stand a chance.\"\n","Processing asent: After a moment's silence, Sam spoke in a strangled voice. \"You don't know Roger. He's a terror.\" \"And the chief--they're both--\" \"--terrors--\" \"--only Roger--\"\n","Processing asent: Both boys froze. Someone was climbing toward them from the tribe. \"He's coming to see if we're keeping watch. Quick, Ralph!\"\n","Processing asent: As he prepared to let himself down the cliff, Ralph snatched at the last possible advantage to be wrung out of this meeting. \"I'll lie up close; in that thicket down there,\" he whispered, \"so keep them away from it. They'll never think to look so close--\"\n","Processing asent: The footsteps were still some distance away. \"Sam--I'm going to be all right, aren't I?\"\n","Processing asent: The twins were silent again. \"Here!\" said Sam suddenly. \"Take this--\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph felt a chunk of meat pushed against him and grabbed it. \"But what are you going to do when you catch me?\"\n","Processing asent: Silence above. He sounded silly to himself. He lowered himself down the rock. \"What are you going to do--?\"\n","Processing asent: From the top of the towering rock came the incomprehensible reply. \"Roger sharpened a stick at both ends.\"\n","Processing asent: Roger sharpened a stick at both ends. Ralph tried to attach a meaning to this but could not. He used all the bad words he could think of in a fit of temper that passed into yawning. How long could you go without sleep? He yearned for a bed and sheets--but the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk, luminous round the rock forty feet below, where Piggy had fallen. Piggy was everywhere, was on this neck, was become terrible in darkness and death. If Piggy were to come back now out of the water, with his empty head--Ralph whimpered and yawned like a littlun. The stick in his hand became a crutch on which he reeled. Then he tensed again. There were voices raised on the top of the Castle Rock. Samneric were arguing with someone. But the ferns and the grass were near. That was the place to be in, hidden, and next to the thicket that would serve for tomorrow's hideout. Here-- and his hands touched grass--was a place to be in for the night, not far from the tribe, so that if the horrors of the supernatural emerged one could at least mix with humans for the time being, even if it meant . . . What did it mean? A stick sharpened at both ends. What was there in that? They had thrown spears and missed; all but one. Perhaps they would miss next time, too. He squatted down in the tall grass, remembered the meat that Sam had given him, and began to tear at it ravenously. While he was eating, he heard fresh noises--cries of pain from Samneric, cries of panic, angry voices. What did it mean? Someone besides himself was in trouble, for at least one of the twins was catching it. Then the voices passed away down the rock and he ceased to think of them. He felt with his hands and found cool, delicate fronds backed against the thicket. Here then was the night's lair. At first light he would creep into the thicket, squeeze between the twisted stems, ensconce himself so deep that only a crawler like himself could come through, and that crawler would be jabbed. There he would sit, and the search would pass him by, and the cordon waver on, ululating along the island, and he would be free. He pulled himself between the ferns, tunneling in. He laid the stick beside him, and huddled himself down in the blackness. One must remember to wake at first light, in order to diddle the savages--and he did not know how quickly sleep came and hurled him down a dark interior slope. He was awake before his eyes were open, listening to a noise that was near. He opened an eye, found the mold an inch or so from his face and his fingers gripped into it, light filtering between the fronds of fern. He had just time to realize that the age-long nightmares of falling and death were past and that the morning was come, when he heard the sound again. It was an ululation over by the seashore-- and now the next savage answered and the next. The cry swept by him across the narrow end of the island from sea to lagoon, like the cry of a flying bird. He took no time to consider but grabbed his sharp stick and wriggled back among the ferns. Within seconds he was worming his way into the thicket; but not before he had glimpsed the legs of a savage coming toward him. The ferns were thumped and beaten and he heard legs moving in the long grass. The savage, whoever he was, ululated twice; and the cry was repeated in both directions, then died away. Ralph crouched still, tangled in the ferns, and for a time he heard nothing. At last he examined the thicket itself. Certainly no one could attack him here--and moreover he had a stroke of luck. The great rock that had killed Piggy had bounded into this thicket and bounced there, right in the center, making a smashed space a few feet in extent each way. When Ralph had wriggled into this he felt secure, and clever. He sat down carefully among the smashed stems and waited for the hunt to pass. Looking up between the leaves he caught a glimpse of something red. That must be the top of the Castle Rock, distant and unmenacing. He composed himself triumphantly, to hear the sounds of the hunt dying away. Yet no one made a sound; and as the minutes passed, in the green shade, his feeling of triumph faded. At last he heard a voice--Jack's voice, but hushed. \"Are you certain?\"\n","Processing asent: The savage addressed said nothing. Perhaps he made a gesture. Roger spoke. \"If you're fooling us--\"\n","Processing asent: Immediately after this, there came a gasp, and a squeal of pain. Ralph crouched instinctively. One of the twins was there, outside the thicket, with Jack and Roger. \"You're sure he meant in there?\"\n","Processing asent: The twin moaned faintly and then squealed again. \"He meant he'd hide in there?\" \"Yes--yes--oh--!\"\n","Processing asent: Silver laughter scattered among the trees. So they knew. Ralph picked up his stick and prepared for battle. But what could they do? It would take them a week to break a path through the thicket; and anyone who wormed his way in would be helpless. He felt the point of his spear with his thumb and grinned without amusement. Whoever tried that would be stuck, squealing like a pig. They were going away, back to the tower rock. He could hear feet moving and then someone sniggered. There came again that high, bird-like cry that swept along the line. So some were still watching for him; but some--? There was a long, breathless silence. Ralph found that he had bark in his mouth from the gnawed spear. He stood and peered upwards to the Castle Rock. As he did so, he heard Jack's voice from the top. \"Heave! Heave! Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: The red rock that he could see at the top of the cliff vanished like a curtain, and he could see figures and blue sky. A moment later the earth jolted, there was a rushing sound in the air, and the top of the thicket was cuffed as with a gigantic hand. The rock bounded on, thumping and smashing toward the beach, while a shower of broken twigs and leaves fell on him. Beyond the thicket, the tribe was cheering. Silence again. Ralph put his fingers in his mouth and bit them. There was only one other rock up there that they might conceivably move; but that was half as big as a cottage, big as a car, a tank. He visualized its probable progress with agonizing clearness--that one would start slowly, drop from ledge to ledge, trundle across the neck like an outsize steamroller. \"Heave! Heave! Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph put down his spear, then picked it up again. He pushed his hair back irritably, took two hasty steps across the little space and then came back. He stood looking at the broken ends of branches. Still silence. He caught sight of the rise and fall of his diaphragm and was surprised to see how quickly he was breathing. Just left of center his heart-beats were visible. He put the spear down again. \"Heave! Heave! Heave!\"\n","Processing asent: A shrill, prolonged cheer. Something boomed up on the red rock, then the earth jumped and began to shake steadily, while the noise as steadily increased. Ralph was shot into the air, thrown down, dashed against branches. At his right hand, and only a few feet away, the whole thicket bent and the roots screamed as they came out of the earth together. He saw something red that turned over slowly as a mill wheel. Then the red thing was past and the elephantine progress diminished toward the sea. Ralph knelt on the plowed-up soil, and waited for the earth to come back. Presently the white, broken stumps, the split sticks and the tangle of the thicket refocused. There was a kind of heavy feeling in his body where he had watched his own pulse. Silence again. Yet not entirely so. They were whispering out there; and suddenly the branches were shaken furiously at two places on his right. The pointed end of a stick appeared. In panic, Ralph thrust his own stick through the crack and struck with all his might. \"Aaa-ah!\"\n","Processing asent: His spear twisted a little in his hands and then he withdrew it again. \"Ooh-ooh--\"\n","Processing asent: Someone was moaning outside and a babble of voices rose. A fierce argument was going on and the wounded savage kept groaning. Then when there was silence, a single voice spoke and Ralph decided that it was not Jack's. \"See? I told you--he's dangerous.\"\n","Processing asent: The wounded savage moaned again. What else? What next? Ralph fastened his hands round the chewed spear and his hair fell. Someone was muttering, only a few yards away toward the Castle Rock. He heard a savage say \"No!\" in a shocked voice; and then there was suppressed laughter. He squatted back on his heels and showed his teeth at the wall of branches. He raise his spear, snarled a little, and waited. Once more the invisible group sniggered. He heard a curious trickling sound and then a louder crepitation as if someone were unwrapping great sheets of cellophane. A stick snapped and he stifled a cough. Smoke was seeping through the branches in white and yellow wisps, the patch of blue sky overhead turned to the color of a storm cloud, and then the smoke billowed round him. Someone laughed excitedly, and a voice shouted. \"Smoke!\"\n","Processing asent: He wormed his way through the thicket toward the forest, keeping as far as possible beneath the smoke. Presently he saw open space, and the green leaves of the edge of the thicket. A smallish savage was standing between him and the rest of the forest, a savage striped red and white, and carrying a spear. He was coughing and smearing the paint about his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to see through the increasing smoke. Ralph launched himself like a cat; stabbed, snarling, with the spear, and the savage doubled up. There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then Ralph was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth. He came to a pig-run, followed it for perhaps a hundred yards, and then swerved off. Behind him the ululation swept across the island once more and a single voice shouted three times. He guessed that was the signal to advance and sped away again, till his chest was like fire. Then he flung himself down under a bush and waited for a moment till his breathing steadied. He passed his tongue tentatively over his teeth and lips and heard far off the ululation of the pursuers. There were many things he could do. He could climb a tree; but that was putting all his eggs in one basket. If he were detected, they had nothing more difficult to do than wait. If only one had time to think! Another double cry at the same distance gave him a clue to their plan. Any savage balked in the forest would utter the double shout and hold up the line till he was free again. That way they might hope to keep the cordon unbroken right across the island. Ralph thought of the boar that had broken through them with such ease. If necessary, when the chase came too close, he could charge the cordon while it was still thin, burst through, and run back. But run back where? The cordon would turn and sweep again. Sooner or later he would have to sleep or eat--and then he would awaken with hands clawing at him; and the hunt would become a running down. What was to be done, then? The tree? Burst the line like a boar? Either way the choice was terrible. A single cry quickened his heart-beat and, leaping up, he dashed away toward the ocean side and the thick jungle till he was hung up among creepers; he stayed there for a moment with his calves quivering. If only one could have quiet, a long pause, a time to think! And there again, shrill and inevitable, was the ululation sweeping across the island. At that sound he shied like a horse among the creepers and ran once more till he was panting. He flung himself down by some ferns. The tree, or the charge? He mastered his breathing for a moment, wiped his mouth, and told himself to be calm. Samneric were somewhere in that line, and hating it. Or were they? And supposing, instead of them, he met the chief, or Roger who carried death in his hands? Ralph pushed back his tangled hair and wiped the sweat out of his best eye. He spoke aloud. \"Think.\"\n","Processing asent: What was the sensible thing to do? There was no Piggy to talk sense. There was no solemn assembly for debate nor dignity of the conch. \"Think.\"\n","Processing asent: Most, he was beginning to dread the curtain that might waver in his brain, blacking out the sense of danger, making a simpleton of him. A third idea would be to hide so well that the advancing line would pass without discovering him. He jerked his head off the ground and listened. There was another noise to attend to now, a deep grumbling noise, as though the forest itself were angry with him, a somber noise across which the ululations were scribbled excruciatingly as on slate. He knew he had heard it before somewhere, but had no time to remember. Break the line. A tree. Hide, and let them pass. A nearer cry stood him on his feet and immediately he was away again, running fast among thorns and brambles. Suddenly he blundered into the open, found himself again in that open space--and there was the fathom-wide grin of the skull, no longer ridiculing a deep blue patch of sky but jeering up into a blanket of smoke. Then Ralph was running beneath trees, with the grumble of the forest explained. They had smoked him out and set the island on fire. Hide was better than a tree because you had a chance of breaking the line if you were discovered. Hide, then. He wondered if a pig would agree, and grimaced at nothing. Find the deepest thicket, the darkest hole on the island, and creep in. Now, as he ran, he peered about him. Bars and splashes of sunlight flitted over him and sweat made glistening streaks on his dirty body. The cries were far now, and faint. At last he found what seemed to him the right place, though the decision was desperate. Here, bushes and a wild tangle of creeper made a mat that kept out all the light of the sun. Beneath it was a space, perhaps a foot high, though it was pierced everywhere by parallel and rising stems. If you wormed into the middle of that you would be five yards from the edge, and hidden, unless the savage chose to lie down and look for you; and even then, you would be in darkness--and if the worst happened and he saw you, then you had a chance to burst out at him, fling the whole line out of step and double back. Cautiously, his stick trailing behind him, Ralph wormed between the rising stems. When he reached the middle of the mat he lay and listened. The fire was a big one and the drum-roll that he had thought was left so far behind was nearer. Couldn't a fire outrun a galloping horse? He could see the sun-splashed ground over an area of perhaps fifty yards from where he lay, and as he watched, the sunlight in every patch blinked at him. This was so like the curtain that flapped in his brain that for a moment he thought the blinking was inside him. But then the patches blinked more rapidly, dulled and went out, so that he saw that a great heaviness of smoke lay between the island and the sun. If anyone peered under the bushes and chanced to glimpse human flesh it might be Samneric who would pretend not to see and say nothing. He laid his cheek against the chocolate-colored earth, licked his dry lips and closed his eyes. Under the thicket, the earth was vibrating very slightly; or perhaps there was a sound beneath the obvious thunder of the fire and scribbled ululations that was too low to hear. Someone cried out. Ralph jerked his cheek off the earth and looked into the dulled light. They must be near now, he thought, and his chest began to thump. Hide, break the line, climb a tree--which was the best after all? The trouble was you only had one chance. Now the fire was nearer; those volleying shots were great limbs, trunks even, bursting. The fools! The fools! The fire must be almost at the fruit trees--what would they eat tomorrow? Ralph stirred restlessly in his narrow bed. One chanced nothing! What could they do? Beat him? So what? Kill him? A stick sharpened at both ends. The cries, suddenly nearer, jerked him up. He could see a striped savage moving hastily out of a green tangle, and coming toward the mat where he hid, a savage who carried a spear. Ralph gripped his fingers into the earth. Be ready now, in case. Ralph fumbled to hold his spear so that it was point foremost; and now he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends. The savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry. Perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire. Don't scream. Get ready. The savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down. That was the butt of his spear. Now you could see him from the knee down. Don't scream. A herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest. Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered. Five yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and cried out. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again. The ululation spread from shore to shore. The savage knelt down by the edge of the thicket, and there were lights flickering in the forest behind him. You could see a knee disturb the mold. Now the other. Two hands. A spear. A face. The savage peered into the obscurity beneath the thicket. You could tell that he saw light on this side and on that, but not in the middle--there. In the middle was a blob of dark and the savage wrinkled up his face, trying to decipher the darkness. The seconds lengthened. Ralph was looking straight into the savage's eyes. Don't scream. You'll get back. Now he's seen you. He's making sure. A stick sharpened. Ralph screamed, a scream of fright and anger and desperation. His legs straightened, the screams became continuous and foaming. He shot forward, burst the thicket, was in the open, screaming, snarling, bloody. He swung the stake and the savage tumbled over; but there were others coming toward him, crying out. He swerved as a spear flew past and then was silent, running. All at once the lights flickering ahead of him merged together, the roar of the forest rose to thunder and a tall bush directly in his path burst into a great fan-shaped flame. He swung to the right, running desperately fast, with the heat beating on his left side and the fire racing forward like a tide. The ululation rose behind him and spread along, a series of short sharp cries, the sighting call. A brown figure showed up at his right and fell away. They were all running, all crying out madly. He could hear them crashing in the undergrowth and on the left was the hot, bright thunder of the fire. He forgot his wounds, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet, rushing through the forest toward the open beach. Spots jumped before his eyes and turned into red circles that expanded quickly till they passed out of sight. Below him someone's legs were getting tired and the desperate ululation advanced like a jagged fringe of menace and was almost overhead. He stumbled over a root and the cry that pursued him rose even higher. He saw a shelter burst into flames and the fire flapped at his right shoulder and there was the glitter of water. Then he was down, rolling over and over in the warm sand, crouching with arm to ward off, trying to cry for mercy. He staggered to his feet, tensed for more terrors, and looked up at a huge peaked cap. It was a white-topped cap, and above the green shade of the peak was a crown, an anchor, gold foliage. He saw white drill, epaulettes, a revolver, a row of gilt buttons down the front of a uniform. A naval officer stood on the sand, looking down at Ralph in wary astonishment. On the beach behind him was a cutter, her bows hauled up and held by two ratings. In the sternsheets another rating held a sub-machine gun. The ululation faltered and died away. The officer looked at Ralph doubtfully for a moment, then took his hand away from the butt of the revolver. \"Hullo.\"\n","Processing asent: Squirming a little, conscious of his filthy appearance, Ralph answered shyly. \"Hullo.\"\n","Processing asent: The officer nodded, as if a question had been answered. \"Are there any adults--any grownups with you?\"\n","Processing asent: Dumbly, Ralph shook his head. He turned a halfpace on the sand. A semicircle of little boys, their bodies streaked with colored clay, sharp sticks in their hands, were standing on the beach making no noise at all. \"Fun and games,\" said the officer. The fire reached the coconut palms by the beach and swallowed them noisily. A flame, seemingly detached, swung like an acrobat and licked up the palm heads on the platform. The sky was black. The officer grinned cheerfully at Ralph. \"We saw your smoke. What have you been doing? Having a war or something?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph nodded. The officer inspected the little scarecrow in front of him. The kid needed a bath, a haircut, a nose-wipe and a good deal of ointment. \"Nobody killed, I hope? Any dead bodies?\" \"Only two. And they've gone.\"\n","Processing asent: The officer leaned down and looked closely at Ralph. \"Two? Killed?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph nodded again. Behind him, the whole island was shuddering with flame. The officer knew, as a rule, when people were telling the truth. He whistled softly. Other boys were appearing now, tiny tots some of them, brown, with the distended bellies of small savages. One of them came close to the officer and looked up. \"I'm, I'm--\"\n","Processing asent: But there was no more to come. Percival Wemys Madison sought in his head for an incantation that had faded clean away. The officer turned back to Ralph. \"We'll take you off. How many of you are there?\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph shook his head. The officer looked past him to the group of painted boys. \"Who's boss here?\" \"I am,\" said Ralph loudly. A little boy who wore the remains of an extraordinary black cap on his red hair and who carried the remains of a pair of spectacles at his waist, started forward, then changed his mind and stood still. \"We saw your smoke. And you don't know how many of you there are?\" \"No, sir.\" \"I should have thought,\" said the officer as he visualized the search before him, \"I should have thought that a pack of British boys--you're all British, aren't you?--would have been able to put up a better show than that--I mean--\" \"It was like that at first,\" said Ralph, \"before things--\"\n","Processing asent: He stopped. \"We were together then--\"\n","Processing asent: The officer nodded helpfully. \"I know. Jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.\"\n","Processing asent: Ralph looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches. But the island was scorched up like dead wood-- Simon was dead--and Jack had. . . . The tears began to flow and sobs shook him. He gave himself up to them now for the first time on the island; great, shuddering spasms of grief that seemed to wrench his whole body. His voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island; and infected by that emotion, the other little boys began to shake and sob too. And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.\n","Processing asent: The officer, surrounded by these noises, was moved and a little embarrassed.\n","Processing asent: He turned away to give them time to pull themselves together; and waited, allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.\n","About to return sents_ls with len = 6068\n","CPU times: user 9min 17s, sys: 20.1 s, total: 9min 37s\n","Wall time: 10min
