Virtually all long text contains narrative elements...(TODO: Insert excerpts from Paper Abstract/Intro Sections here)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **SentimentArcs: Cloning the Github repository to your gDrive**\n","\n","If this is the first time using SentimentArcs, you will need to copy the software from our Github.com repository (github repo). The default recommended gDrive path is ./gdrive/MyDrive/research/sentiment_arcs/'. \n","\n","The first time you run this notebook and connect your Google gDrive, it will allow to to specify the path to your SentimentArcs subdirectory. If it does not exists, this notebook will copy/clone the SentimentArcs github repository code to your gDrive at the path you specify.\n","\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **NovelText: A Reference Corpus of 24 Diverse Novel**\n","\n","Sentiment Arcs comes with a carefully curated reference corpus of Novels to illustrate the unique diachronic sentiment analysis characteristic of long form fictional narrativeas. This corpus of 24 diverse novels also provides a baseline for exploring and comparing new novels with sentiment analysis using SentimentArcs.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Preparing New Novels: Formatting and adding to subdirectory**\n","\n","To analyze new novels with SentimentArcs, the body of the text should consist of plain text organized in to blocks separated by two newlines which visually look like a single blank line between blocks. These blocks are usually paragraphs but can also include title headers, separate lines of dialog or quotes. Please reference any of the 24 novels in the NovelText corpus for examples of this expected format.\n","\n","Once the new novel is correctly formatted as a plain text file, it should follow this standard file naming convention:\n","\n","[first letter of first name]+[full lastname]_[abbreviated book title].txt\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","* fdouglass_narrativelifeofaslave\n","* fscottfitzgerald_thegreatgatsby.txt\n","* vwoolf_mrsdalloway.txt\n","* homer-ewilson_odyssey.txt (trans. E.Wilson)\n","* mproust-mtreharne_3guermantesway.txt (Book 3, trans. M.Treharne)\n","* staugustine_confessions9end.txt (Upto and incl Book 9)\n","\n","Note the optional author suffix (-translator) and optional title suffix (-selected chapters/books)\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **Adding New Novels: Add file to subdirectory and Update this Notebook**\n","\n","Once you have a cleaned and text file named according the standard rule above, you must move that file to the subdirectory of all input novels and update the global variable in this notebook that defines which novels to analyze.\n","\n","First, copy your cleaned text file to the subdirectory containing all novels read by this notebook. This subdir is defined by the program variable 'subdir_novels' with the default value './in1_novels/'\n","\n","Second, update the program variable 'novels_dt'. This is a Dictionary data structure that following the pattern below:\n","```\n","novels_dt = {\n","  'cdickens_achristmascarol':['A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ',1843,1399],\n","```\n","Where the first string (the dictionary key) must match the filename root without the '.txt' suffix (e.g. cdickens_achristmascarol). The Dictionary value after the ':' is a list of three elements:\n","\n","* A nicely formatted string of the form '(title) by (full first and last name of author)' that should be a human friendly string used to label plots and saved files.\n","\n","* The (publication year) and the (sentence count). Both are optional, but should have placeholder string '0' if unknown. These are intended for future reference and analytics.\n","\n","* Your future self will thank you if you insert new novels into the 'novels_dt' in alphabetic order for faster and more accurate reference.\n","\n","***\n","\n","* **How to Execute SentimentArcs Notebooks:**\n","\n","This is a Jupyter Notebook created to run on Google's free Colab service using only a browers and your exiting Google email account. We chose Google Colab because it is relatively, fast, free, easy to use and makes collaboration as simple as web browsing.\n","\n","A few reminders about using Jupyter Notebooks general and SentimentArcs in particular:\n","\n","* All cells must be run ***in order*** as later code cells often depend upon the output of earlier code cells\n","\n","* ***Cells that take more time to execute*** (> 1 min) usually begin with *%%time* which outputs the *total execution time* of the last run.  This timing output is deleted and recalculated each time the code cell is executed.\n","\n","* **[OPTIONAL]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* change a setting in that cell to customize behavior.\n","\n","* **[CUSTOMIZE]** at the top of a cell indicates you *must* change a setting in that cell.\n","\n","* **[RESTART REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you *may* see a *[RESTART REQUIRED] button* at the end of the output. *If you see this button, you must select [Runtime]->[Restart Runtime] from the top menubar.\n","\n","* **[INPUT REQUIRED]** at the top of a cell indicates you will be required to take some action for execution to proceed, usually by clicking a button or entering the response to a prompt.\n","\n","All cells with a top comment prefixed with # [OPTIONAL]: indicates that you can change a setting to customize behavior, the prefix [CUSTOMIZE] indicates you MUST set/change a setting\n","\n","* SentimentArcs divides workflow into a series of chronological Jupyter Notebooks that must be run in order. Here is an overview of the workflow:\n","\n","***\n","\n","**SentimentArcs Notebooks Workflow**\n","1. Notebook #1: Preprocess Text\n","2. Notebook #2: Compute Sentiment Values (Simple Models/CPUs)\n","3. Notebook #3: Compute Sentiment Values (Complex Models/GPUs)\n","4. Notebook #4: Combine all Sentiment Values, perform Time Series analysis, and extract Crux points and surrounding text\n","\n","If you are unfamilar with setting up and using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, here are a series of resources to quickly bring you up to speed. If you are using SentimentArcs with the Cambridge University Press Elements textbook, there are also a series of videos by Prof Elkins and Chun stepping you through these notebooks.\n","\n","***\n","\n","**Additional Resources and Tutorials**\n","\n","\n","**Google Colab and Jupyter Resources:**\n","\n","* Coming...\n","* [IPython, Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.00-ipython-beyond-normal-python.html) \n","\n","**Cambridge University Press Videos:**\n","\n","* Coming...\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **[STEP 1] Configuration and Setup**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vgvTrI7bevn2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mGoFJmeFkTxk"},"source":["## Configure Jupyter Notebook"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0CkX9gONAsmp"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Ignore warnings\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kK8zKENjsyig"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Configure Jupyter\n","\n","# Enable multiple outputs from one code cell\n","from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell\n","InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = \"all\"\n","\n","from IPython.display import display\n","from IPython.display import Image\n","from ipywidgets import widgets, interactive"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## [INPUT] Connect Google gDrive to this Jupyter Notebook"],"metadata":{"id":"qkcsI681TaDM"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2bfkqjgMiw7T","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1646000242576,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":25763,"user":{"displayName":"Jon Chun","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"14430240466678867548"}},"outputId":"36cda91d-4550-4a9e-cb5c-10688cc043a3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Attempting to attach your Google gDrive to this Colab Jupyter Notebook\n","Mounted at /gdrive\n"]}],"source":["# [INPUT REQUIRED]: Authorize access to Google gDrive\n","\n","# Connect this Notebook to your permanent Google Drive\n","#   so all generated output is saved to permanent storage there\n","\n","try:\n","  from google.colab import drive\n","  IN_COLAB=True\n","except:\n","  IN_COLAB=False\n","\n","if IN_COLAB:\n","  print(\"Attempting to attach your Google gDrive to this Colab Jupyter Notebook\")\n","  drive.mount('/gdrive')\n","else:\n","  print(\"Your Google gDrive is attached to this Colab Jupyter Notebook\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lpxXvi4Xi9VP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1646000243703,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1148,"user":{"displayName":"Jon Chun","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"14430240466678867548"}},"outputId":"b38b42fe-1f8e-46f5-fea8-db03f0352a16"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["subdir_parent: /gdrive/MyDrive/cdh\n","/gdrive/MyDrive/cdh\n","fatal: destination path 'nabokov_palefire' already exists and is not an empty directory.\n","/gdrive/MyDrive/cdh/nabokov_palefire\n","Foreword_Text.txt  palefire_clean_parts  Poem.txt  README.md\n"]}],"source":["# [CUSTOMIZE]: Change the text after the Unix '%cd ' command below (change directory)\n","#              to math the full path to your gDrive subdirectory which should be the \n","#              root directory cloned from the SentimentArcs github repo.\n","\n","# NOTE: Make sure this subdirectory already exists and there are \n","#       no typos, spaces or illegals characters (e.g. periods) in the full path after %cd\n","\n","# NOTE: In Python all strings must begin with an upper or lowercase letter, and only\n","#         letter, number and underscores ('_') characters should appear afterwards.\n","#         Make sure your full path after %cd obeys this constraint or errors may appear.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Step #1: Get full path to SentimentArcs subdir on gDrive\n","# =======\n","#@markdown **Accept default path on gDrive or Enter new one:**\n","\n","Path_to_SentimentArcs = \"/gdrive/MyDrive/cdh/sentiment_arcs/\" #@param [\"/gdrive/MyDrive/sentiment_arcs/\"] {allow-input: true}\n","\n","#@markdown (e.g. /gdrive/MyDrive/research/sentiment_arcs/)\n","\n","\n","\n","# Step #2: Move to Parent directory of Sentiment_Arcs\n","# =======\n","parentdir_sentiment_arcs = '/'.join(Path_to_SentimentArcs.split('/')[:-2])\n","print(f'subdir_parent: {parentdir_sentiment_arcs}')\n","%cd $parentdir_sentiment_arcs\n","\n","\n","# Step #3: If project sentiment_arcs subdir does not exist, \n","#          clone it from github\n","# =======\n","import os\n","\n","if ~os.path.isdir('sentiment_arcs'):\n","  #

foreigners.\n","Processing asent: Well, we could moan together about whatever it was we missed from home.\n","Processing asent: Have you heard of Marmite?\n","Processing asent: Then youve obviously never met a British spy in exile.\n","Processing asent: He poured me and Dhatt, unbidden, glasses of red wine.\n","Processing asent: We spoke in Illitan.\n","Processing asent: This was years ago, you understand.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma didnt have a pot to piss in.\n","Processing asent: It had to think about efficiencies.\n","Processing asent: There was always one Ul Qoman living in each of these buildings.\n","Processing asent: Much easier for a single person to keep an eye on several foreign visitors if they were all in one place.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt met his eye.Fuck off, these truths dont intimidate me , his expression said.\n","Processing asent: Bowden smiled a little bashfully.\n","Processing asent: Wasnt it a bit insulting?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Honoured visitors, sympaticos being watched like that?\n","Processing asent: Might have been for some of them, Bowden said.\n","Processing asent: The Philbys of Ul Qoma, the real fellow travellers, were probably rather put out.\n","Processing asent: But then theyd also be the ones most likely to put up with anything.\n","Processing asent: I never particularly objected to being watched.\n","Processing asent: They were right not to trust me.\n","Processing asent: He sipped his drink.\n","Processing asent: How are you getting on withBetween , Inspector?\n","Processing asent: His walls were painted beiges and browns in need of renovation, and busy with bookshelves and books and the folk art in Ul Qoman and Bes styles, antique maps of both cities.\n","Processing asent: On surfaces were figurines and the remnants of pottery, tiny clockwork-looking things.\n","Processing asent: The living room was not large, and so full of bits and pieces it was cramped.\n","Processing asent: You were here when Mahalia was killed, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: I have no alibi, if thats what you mean.\n","Processing asent: My neighbour might have heard me puttering about, ask her, but I dont know.\n","Processing asent: How long have you lived here?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt pursed his lips without looking at me.\n","Processing asent: God, years.\n","Processing asent: And why here?\n","Processing asent: I dont understand.\n","Processing asent: So far as I can tell you have at least as much Bes stuff as local.\n","Processing asent: I pointed at one of the many old or reproduction Bes icons.\n","Processing asent: Is there a particular reason you ended up here rather than Besel?\n","Processing asent: Or anywhere else?\n","Processing asent: Bowden turned his hands so that his palms faced the ceiling.\n","Processing asent: Im an archaeologist.\n","Processing asent: I dont know how much you know about this stuff.\n","Processing asent: Most of the artefacts that are worth looking at, including the ones that look to us now like they were made by Bes craftsmen, are in Ul Qoman soil.\n","Processing asent: Thats just how its always been.\n","Processing asent: The situation was never helped by Besels idiotic willingness to sell what little heritage it could dig up to whoever wanted it.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qomas always been smarter about that.\n","Processing asent: Even a dig like Bol Yean?\n","Processing asent: You mean under foreign direction?\n","Processing asent: Sure.\n","Processing asent: The Canadians dont technically own any of it; they just have some handling and cataloguing rights.\n","Processing asent: Plus the kudos they get from writing up, and a warm glow.\n","Processing asent: And dibs on museum tours, of course.\n","Processing asent: The Canadians are happy as Larry about the US blockade, believe me.\n","Processing asent: Want to see a very vivid green?\n","Processing asent: Tell an American archaeologist you work in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Have you seen Ul Qomas laws on antiquities export?\n","Processing asent: He closed his hands, fingers interlocking like a trap.\n","Processing asent: Everyone who wants to work on Ul Qoma, or Besel, let alone if theyre into Precursor Age, ends up here if they can get here.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia was an American archaeologist Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Student, Bowden said.\n","Processing asent: When she finished her PhD shed have had a harder time staying.\n","Processing asent: I was standing, glancing into his study.\n","Processing asent: Could I ?\n","Processing asent: I indicated in.\n","Processing asent: I sure.\n","Processing asent: He was embarrassed at the tiny space.\n","Processing asent: It was if anything even more cramped with the tat of antiquity than his living room.\n","Processing asent: His desk was its own archaeology of papers, computer cables, a street-finder map of Ul Qoma, battered and several years old.\n","Processing asent: Amid the mess of papers were some in a strange and very ancient script, neither Illitan nor Bes, pre-Cleaved.\n","Processing asent: I could not read any of it.\n","Processing asent: Whats this?\n","Processing asent: Oh He rolled his eyes.\n","Processing asent: It arrived yesterday morning.\n","Processing asent: I still get crank mail.\n","Processing asent: SinceBetween .\n","Processing asent: Stuff that people put together and say is in the script of Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Im supposed todecode it for them.\n","Processing asent: Maybe the poor sods really believe its something.\n","Processing asent: Can you decode that one?\n","Processing asent: Are you kidding?\n","Processing asent: It doesnt mean anything.\n","Processing asent: He closed the door.\n","Processing asent: No news of Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: This is seriously worrying.\n","Processing asent: Im afraid not, said Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Missing Persons are on it.\n","Processing asent: Theyre very good.\n","Processing asent: Were working closely with them.\n","Processing asent: We absolutely have to find her, Officers.\n","Processing asent: Im This is crucial.\n","Processing asent: Do you have any idea who might have any grievance against Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: My God no, shes sweet, I cant think of anyone.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia was a bit different.\n","Processing asent: I mean Mahalia was what happened to her was utterly appalling.\n","Processing asent: Appalling.\n","Processing asent: She was smart, very smart, and opinionated, and brave, and it isnt quite so What Im saying is I can imagine Mahalia getting people angry.\n","Processing asent: She did that.\n","Processing asent: Its the kind of person she was, and I mean that as a compliment.\n","Processing asent: But there was always that fear that Mahalia might one day piss off the wrong person.\n","Processing asent: Who might she have pissed off?\n","Processing asent: Im not talking specifics, Senior Detective, I have no idea.\n","Processing asent: We didnt have very much contact, Mahalia and I.\n","Processing asent: I hardly knew her.\n","Processing asent: Small campus, I said.\n","Processing asent: Surely you all knew everyone.\n","Processing asent: True.\n","Processing asent: But honestly I avoided her.\n","Processing asent: We hadnt spoken for a longtime.\n","Processing asent: We didnt get off to a very auspicious start.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda, though, I know.\n","Processing asent: And shes nothing like that.\n","Processing asent: Shes not as clever, maybe, but I cannot think of a single person who doesnt like her, nor why anyone would want to do anything to her.\n","Processing asent: Everyones horrified.\n","Processing asent: Including the locals who work there.\n","Processing asent: Would they have been devastated about Mahalia, too?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I doubt any of them knew her, to be frank.\n","Processing asent: One of the guards seemed to.\n","Processing asent: Made a point of asking us about her.\n","Processing asent: About Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: I thought he might be her boyfriend or something.\n","Processing asent: One of the guards?\n","Processing asent: Absolutely not.\n","Processing asent: Sorry, that sounded a bit peremptory.\n","Processing asent: What I mean is that Id be amazed.\n","Processing asent: Knowing what I do of Mahalia, I mean.\n","Processing asent: Which isnt much, you said.\n","Processing asent: But, you know, you pick up on whos doing what, which students do what.\n","Processing asent: Some of themYolandas onehang out with the Ul Qoman staff, but not Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: You will tell me if you find anything out about Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: You have to find her.\n","Processing asent: Or even if you just have theories about where she is, please, this is terrible.\n","Processing asent: Youre Yolandas supervisor?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Whats her PhD on?\n","Processing asent: He waved.\n","Processing asent: Representing Gender and the Other in Precursor Age Artefacts.\n","Processing asent: I still prefer pre-Cleavage but it makes an unfortunate pun in English, so Precursor Age is the newly preferred term.\n","Processing asent: You said shes not smart?\n","Processing asent: I did not say that.\n","Processing asent: Shes perfectly intelligent enough.\n","Processing asent: Its fine.\n","Processing asent: Shes just There arent that many people like Mahalia in any postgraduate program.\n","Processing asent: So why werent you her supervisor?\n","Processing asent: He stared at me as if I was mocking him.\n","Processing asent: Because of herbullshit , Inspector, he said at last.\n","Processing asent: He stood and turned his back, seemed to want to walk around the room, but it was too small.\n","Processing asent: Yes, these were the tricky circumstances under which we met.\n","Processing asent: He turned back to us.\n","Processing asent: Senior Detective Dhatt, Inspector Borl.\n","Processing asent: Do you know how many PhD students I have?\n","Processing asent: One.\n","Processing asent: Because no one else wanted her.\n","Processing asent: Poor thing.\n","Processing asent: I have no office at Bol Yean.\n","Processing asent: Ihave no tenure nor am I on tenure track.\n","Processing asent: Do you know what my official title is, at Prince of Wales?\n","Processing asent: Im aCorresponding Lecturer .\n","Processing asent: Dont ask me what that means.\n","Processing asent: Actually, I can tell you what it meansit meansWe are the worlds leading institution for Ul Qoma, Besel and Precursor Age studies, and we need all the names we can get, and we may even entice a few rich kooks onto our program with your moniker, but we are not so stupid as to give you a real job.\n","Processing asent: Because of the book?\n","Processing asent: Because ofBetween the City and the City .\n","Processing asent: Because I was a stoned young man with a neglectful supervisor and a taste for the arcane.\n","Processing asent: No matter that you turn around a little later and say Mea culpa, I messed up, no Orciny, my apologies.\n","Processing asent: No matter that eighty-five percent of the researchstill holds up and is still used .\n","Processing asent: Hear me?\n","Processing asent: No matter what else you do, ever.\n","Processing asent: You can never walk away from it no matter how hard you try.\n","Processing asent: So when, as happens regularly, someone comes to me and tells me that the work that fucked things up isso great, and that shedlove to work with meand this is what Mahalia did at the conference over in Besel where I first met herand that itssuch a travesty that the truth is still banned in both cities, and that sheson my side Did you know by the way that when she first arrived here she not only smuggled a copy ofBetween into Besel but told me she was going to shelve it in the history section of the University Library, for Christs sake?\n","Processing asent: For people to find?\n","Processing asent: She told me that proudly.\n","Processing asent: I told her to get rid of it immediately or I would set thepoliczai on her.\n","Processing asent: Anyway, when she tells me all that, yes, I got shirty.\n","Processing asent: I meet these people pretty much every conference I go to.\n","Processing asent: I tell themI was wrong and they think either that Ive been bought off by the Man, or that Im afraid for my life.\n","Processing asent: Or that Ive been replaced by a robot or something.\n","Processing asent: Did Yolanda ever talk about Mahalia?\n","Processing asent: Wasnt it hard, you feeling like that about her best friend\n","Processing asent: Feeling like what?\n","Processing asent: There was nothing, Inspector.\n","Processing asent: I told her I wouldnt supervise her; she accused me of cowardice or capitulation or something, I cant remember; that was the last of it.\n","Processing asent: I gathered that shed more or less shut up about Orciny in the years since shedbeen on the program.\n","Processing asent: I thoughtgood , shes grown out of it.\n","Processing asent: That was it.\n","Processing asent: And I heard she was clever.\n","Processing asent: I got the impression Professor Nancy was a bit disappointed with her.\n","Processing asent: Maybe.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: She wouldnt be the first person to be a letdown in writing, but she still had a reputation.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda wasnt into Orciny stuff?\n","Processing asent: Thats not why she was studying with you?\n","Processing asent: He sighed and sat down again.\n","Processing asent: It was unimpressive, his lacklustre up-down.\n","Processing asent: I thought not.\n","Processing asent: I wouldnt have supervised her.\n","Processing asent: And no, not at first but shed mentioned it recently.\n","Processing asent: Brought updissensi , what might live there, all that.\n","Processing asent: She knew my feelings, so she was trying to act as if it was all hypotheticals.\n","Processing asent: It sounds ridiculous, but it honestly hadnt even occurred to me that it was because of Mahalias influence.\n","Processing asent: Was she talking to her about it?\n","Processing asent: Do you know?\n","Processing asent: Tell us about thedissensi, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Do you know where they are?\n","Processing asent: He shrugged.\n","Processing asent: You know where some are, SD.\n","Processing asent: Theres no secret about lots of them.\n","Processing asent: A few paces of back yard here, a deserted building there.\n","Processing asent: The central five metres or so of Nuistu Park?Dissensus .\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma claims it; Besel claims it.\n","Processing asent: Theyre effectively crosshatched or out of bounds in both cities while the bickering goes on.\n","Processing asent: Theres just not that much exciting about them.\n","Processing asent: Id like a list from you.\n","Processing asent: If you want, but youll get it quicker via your own department, and mine is probably twenty years out of date.\n","Processing asent: They do get resolved, time to time, and new ones emerge.\n","Processing asent: And then you might hear of the secret ones.\n","Processing asent: Id like a list.\n","Processing asent: Hang on, secret?\n","Processing asent: If no one knows theyre disputed, how can they be?\n","Processing asent: Quite.\n","Processing asent: Theyresecretly disputed, SD Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: You have to get your head into the right mindset for this foolishness.\n","Processing asent: Doctor Bowden I said.\n","Processing asent: Do you have any reason to think anyone might have anything againstyou?\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: He was very abruptly alarmed.\n","Processing asent: What have you heard?\n","Processing asent: Nothing, only I said, and paused.\n","Processing asent: Theres some speculation that someone is targeting people whove been investigating Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt made no move to interrupt me.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps you should be careful.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: Idont study Orciny, I havent for years\n","Processing asent: As you say yourself, once youve started this stuff, Doctor Im afraid youre the doyen whether you like it or not.\n","Processing asent: Have you received anything that could be construed as a threat?\n","Processing asent: You were burgled.\n","Processing asent: That was Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: A few weeks ago.\n","Processing asent: We both looked at him.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt was unembarrassed by my surprise.\n","Processing asent: Bowdens mouth worked.\n","Processing asent: But that was just a burglary, he said.\n","Processing asent: Nothing was even taken\n","Processing asent: Yes, because they mustve got startledthat was what we said at the time, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Could be it was never their intent to take anything.\n","Processing asent: Bowden, and more surreptitiously I, looked around the room, as if some malevolent gris-gris or electronic ear or painted threat might jump suddenly to light.\n","Processing asent: SD, Inspector, this is utterly absurd; there is no Orciny\n","Processing asent: But, Dhatt said, there are such things as nutters.\n","Processing asent: Some of whom, I said, for whatever reason are interested in some of the ideas being explored by yourself and Miss Rodriguez, Miss Geary\n","Processing asent: I dont think either of them wereexploring ideas\n","Processing asent: Whatever, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: The point is they got someones attention.\n","Processing asent: No, were not sure why, or even if thereis a why.\n","Processing asent: Bowden was staring absolutely aghast.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Sixteen\n","Processing asent: DHATT TOOK THE LISTBowden gave him and sent an underling to supplement it, sent officers to the itemised lots, derelict buildings, patches of kerb and little promenade spaces on the rivers shore, to scuff stones and probe at the edges of disputed, functionally crosshatched patches.\n","Processing asent: I spoke to Corwi again that nightshe made a joke about hoping this was a secure linebut we were unable to say anything useful to each other.\n","Processing asent: Professor Nancy had sent a printout of Mahalias chapters to the hotel.\n","Processing asent: There were two more or less finished, two somewhat sketchy.\n","Processing asent: I stopped reading them after not very long, looked instead at the photocopies of her annotated textbooks.\n","Processing asent: There was a vivid disparity between the sedate, somewhat dull tone of the former, and the exclamation points and scribbled interjections of the latter, Mahalia arguing with her earlier selves and with the main text.\n","Processing asent: The marginalia were incomparably the more interesting, to the extent that you could make any sense of them.\n","Processing asent: I put them down eventually for Bowdens book.\n","Processing asent: Between the City and the City was tendentious.\n","Processing asent: You could see it.\n","Processing asent: There are secrets in Besel and in Ul Qoma, secrets everyone knows about: it was unnecessary to posit secret secrets.\n","Processing asent: Still, the old stories, the mosaics and bas-reliefs, the artefacts the book referredto were in some cases astonishingbeautiful and startling.\n","Processing asent: Young Bowdens readings of some still-unsolved mysteries of Precursor or Pre-Cleavage age works were ingenious and even convincing.\n","Processing asent: He had an elegantly argued claim that the incomprehensible mechanisms euphemistically slanged as clocks were not mechanisms at all, but intricately chambered boxes designed solely to hold the gears they contained.\n","Processing asent: His leaps to thetherefore were lunatic, as he now admitted.\n","Processing asent: Of course there would be paranoia, for a visitor to this city, where the locals would stare and stare furtively, where I would be watched by Breach, of which snatched glances would not feel like anything I had experienced.\n","Processing asent: My cell phone rang, later, while I was sleeping.\n","Processing asent: It was my Bes phone, showing an international call.\n","Processing asent: It would piss credit, but it was on the government.\n","Processing asent: Borl, I said.\n","Processing asent: Inspector Illitan accent.\n","Processing asent: Who is this?\n","Processing asent: Borl I dont know why you I cant talk long.\n","Processing asent: I thank you.\n","Processing asent: Jaris.\n","Processing asent: I sat up, put my feet on the floor.\n","Processing asent: The young unif.\n","Processing asent: Were not fucking comrades, you know.\n","Processing asent: He was not speaking in Old Illitan this time, but quickly in his own everyday language.\n","Processing asent: Why would we be?\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: I cant stay on the line.\n","Processing asent: You could tell it was me, couldnt you?\n","Processing asent: Who called you in Besel.\n","Processing asent: I wasnt sure.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: This call never fucking happened.\n","Processing asent: I said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Thanks for the other day, he said.\n","Processing asent: For not saying.\n","Processing asent: I met Marya when she came over here.\n","Processing asent: I had not given her that name for a while, but for the moment when Dhatt had questioned the unifs.\n","Processing asent: She told me she knew our brothers and sisters over the border; shed worked with them.\n","Processing asent: But she wasnt one of us, you know.\n","Processing asent: I know.\n","Processing asent: You set me on that track in Besel\n","Processing asent: Shut up.\n","Processing asent: Please.\n","Processing asent: I thought she was at first, but the stuff she was asking about, it was She was into stuff you dont even know about.\n","Processing asent: I would not preempt him.Orciny.\n","Processing asent: He must have interpreted my silence as awe.\n","Processing asent: She didnt give a shit about unification.\n","Processing asent: She was putting everyone in danger so she could use our libraries and our contacts lists I really liked her, but she was trouble.\n","Processing asent: She only cared about Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Borl, she fuckingfound it, Borl.\n","Processing asent: Are you there?\n","Processing asent: Do you understand?\n","Processing asent: She found it\n","Processing asent: How do you know?\n","Processing asent: She told me.\n","Processing asent: None of the others knew.\n","Processing asent: When we realised how dangerous she was she was banned from meetings.\n","Processing asent: They thought she was, like, a spy or something.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt that.\n","Processing asent: You stayed in touch with her.\n","Processing asent: He said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Why, if she was so ?\n","Processing asent: Whyd you call me?\n","Processing asent: In Besel?\n","Processing asent: She deserved better than a potters field.\n","Processing asent: I was surprised he knew the term.\n","Processing asent: Were you together, Jaris?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I hardly knew anything about her.\n","Processing asent: Never asked.\n","Processing asent: Never met her friends.\n","Processing asent: Were careful.\n","Processing asent: But she told me about Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Showed me all her notes about it.\n","Processing asent: She was Listen, Borl, you wont believe me but shedmade contact .\n","Processing asent: There are places\n","Processing asent: No, shut up.\n","Processing asent: Not disputed: places that everyone in Ul Qoma thinks are in Besel, and everyone in Besel thinks are in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Theyre not in either one.\n","Processing asent: Theyre Orciny.\n","Processing asent: She found them.\n","Processing asent: She told me she was helping.\n","Processing asent: Doing what?\n","Processing asent: I only spoke at last because the silence went on so long.\n","Processing asent: I dont know much.\n","Processing asent: She was saving them.\n","Processing asent: They wanted something.\n","Processing asent: She said.\n","Processing asent: Something like that.\n","Processing asent: But when I said to her once How dyou know Orcinys on our side?\n","Processing asent: she just laughed and said I dont, theyre not.\n","Processing asent: She wouldnt tell me a lot.\n","Processing asent: I didnt want to know.She didnt talk about it much at all.\n","Processing asent: I thought she might be crossing, through some of these places, but\n","Processing asent: When did you last see her?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: A few days before she before.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Borl, this is what you need to know.\n","Processing asent: She knew she was in trouble.\n","Processing asent: She got really angry and upset when I said something about Orciny.\n","Processing asent: The last time.\n","Processing asent: She said I didnt understand anything.\n","Processing asent: She said something like she didnt know if what she was doing was restitution or criminal.\n","Processing asent: What does that mean?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: She said Breach wasnothing .\n","Processing asent: I was shocked.\n","Processing asent: Can you imagine?\n","Processing asent: She said everyone who knew the truth about Orciny was in danger.\n","Processing asent: She said there werent many but anyone that did wouldnt even know how much shit they were in, wouldnt believe it.\n","Processing asent: I said Even me?\n","Processing asent: she said Maybe, I maybe already told you too much.\n","Processing asent: What do you think it means?\n","Processing asent: What do you know about Orciny, Borl?\n","Processing asent: Why the fuck would anyone think Orciny was safe to fuck with?\n","Processing asent: How dyou think you stay hidden for centuries?\n","Processing asent: By playing nice?\n","Processing asent: Light!\n","Processing asent: I think somehow she got mixed up working for Orciny, is what I think happened, and I think theyre like parasites, and they told her she was helping them but she found something out, and when she realised theykilled her.\n","Processing asent: He gathered himself.\n","Processing asent: She carried a knife at the end, for protection.\n","Processing asent: FromOrciny.\n","Processing asent: A miserable laugh.\n","Processing asent: They killed her, Borl.\n","Processing asent: And theyre going to kill everyone who might trouble them.\n","Processing asent: Everyone whos ever brought attention to them.\n","Processing asent: What about you?\n","Processing asent: Im fucked, is what.\n","Processing asent: Shes gone, so Im gone too.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma can go fuck itself and so can Besel and so can Or-fucking-ciny.\n","Processing asent: This is my good-bye.\n","Processing asent: Can you hear the sound of wheels?\n","Processing asent: In a minute this phone is going out the fucking window when were done and say-onara.\n","Processing asent: This calls a good-bye present, for her sake.\n","Processing asent: By the last words he was whispering.\n","Processing asent: When I realised he had rung off I tried to call him back but his number was blocked.\n","Processing asent: I RUBBED MY EYESfor long seconds, too long.\n","Processing asent: I scribbled notes on the hotel-headed paper, nothing I would ever look at again, just trying to organise thoughts.\n","Processing asent: I listed people.\n","Processing asent: I saw the clock and did a time-zone calculation.\n","Processing asent: I dialled a long-distance number on the hotel phone.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Geary?\n","Processing asent: Who is this?\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Geary, this is Tyador Borl.\n","Processing asent: Of the Besel police.\n","Processing asent: She said nothing.\n","Processing asent: We May I ask how Mr. Geary is?\n","Processing asent: I walked barefoot to the window.\n","Processing asent: Hes alright, she said finally.\n","Processing asent: Angry.\n","Processing asent: She was very careful.\n","Processing asent: She could not decide about me. I pulled the heavy curtains back a little, looked out.\n","Processing asent: No matter that it was the small hours, there were a few figures visible in the street, as there always are.\n","Processing asent: Now and then a car passed.\n","Processing asent: So late, it was harder to tell who was local and who foreign and so unseeable in the day: the colours of clothes were obscured by streetlamp light and the huddled quick night-walking blurred body language.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to say again how sorry I was about what happened and to make sure you were alright.\n","Processing asent: Have you got anything to tell me?\n","Processing asent: You mean have we caught who did this to your daughter?\n","Processing asent: Im sorry, Mrs. Geary, we have not.\n","Processing asent: But I wanted to ask you I waited, but she did not hang up, nor say anything.\n","Processing asent: Did Mahalia ever tell you she was seeing anyone here?\n","Processing asent: She only made some sound.\n","Processing asent: When I had waited several seconds I continued.\n","Processing asent: Do you know Yolanda Rodriguez?\n","Processing asent: And why was it theBes nationalists Mr. Geary was looking for?\n","Processing asent: When he breached.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia lived in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: She made the sound and I realised that she was crying.\n","Processing asent: I opened my mouth but could only listen to her.\n","Processing asent: Too late as I woke up more I realised that I should perhaps have called from another phone, if my and Corwis suspicions were right.\n","Processing asent: Mrs. Geary did not break the connection, so after a little while I said her name.\n","Processing asent: Why are you asking me about Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: she said finally.\n","Processing asent: She had pulled her voice together.\n","Processing asent: Of course I met her, shes Mahalias friend.\n","Processing asent: Is she ?\n","Processing asent: Were just trying to get hold of her.\n","Processing asent: Oh my God, is shemissing?\n","Processing asent: Mahalia confided in her.\n","Processing asent: Is that why ?\n","Processing asent: Is she ?\n","Processing asent: Please dont, Mrs. Geary.\n","Processing asent: I promise you theres no evidence of anything untoward; she may have just taken a few days away.\n","Processing asent: Please.\n","Processing asent: She started again but controlled herself.\n","Processing asent: They hardly spoke to us on that flight, she said.\n","Processing asent: My husband woke up near the end and realised what had happened.\n","Processing asent: I said, Mrs. Geary, was Mahalia involved with anyone here?\n","Processing asent: That you know of?\n","Processing asent: In Ul Qoma, I mean?\n","Processing asent: She sighed it.\n","Processing asent: Youre thinking How would her mother know?\n","Processing asent: but I would.\n","Processing asent: She didnt tell me details, but she She gathered herself.\n","Processing asent: There was someone who hung around with her, but she didnt like him that way.\n","Processing asent: Said it was toocomplicated.\n","Processing asent: What was his name?\n","Processing asent: Dont you think Id have told you?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: She met him through politics, I think.\n","Processing asent: You mentioned Qoma First.\n","Processing asent: Oh, my girl made them all mad.\n","Processing asent: She laughed a bit.\n","Processing asent: She got people sore on all sides of it.\n","Processing asent: And even the unifiers, is that what they are?\n","Processing asent: Michael was going to check them all.\n","Processing asent: It was easier to find names and addresses for Besel.\n","Processing asent: Thats where we were.\n","Processing asent: He was going to check them all out, one at a time.\n","Processing asent: He wanted to find them all, because one of themdid this.\n","Processing asent: I promised her all the things she wanted me to, rubbing my forehead and staring at Ul Qomas silhouettes.\n","Processing asent: Not later enough, I was woken by Dhatts phone call.\n","Processing asent: Are you still in fucking bed?\n","Processing asent: Get up.\n","Processing asent: How long before you It was morning, not that early.\n","Processing asent: Im downstairs.\n","Processing asent: Hurry up, come on.\n","Processing asent: Someone sent a bomb.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Seventeen\n","Processing asent: IN BOL YEANmen of the Ul Qoma bomb squad lounged outside the tiny ersatz postroom, talking to several awed security guards, chewing, squat in their protective clothes.\n","Processing asent: The squad wore their visors up, angling from their foreheads.\n","Processing asent: You Dhatt?\n","Processing asent: Its cool, SD, one said, glancing at Dhatts insignia.\n","Processing asent: You can go in.\n","Processing asent: He eyed me and opened the door onto the cupboard-sized room.\n","Processing asent: Who caught it?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: One of the security boys.\n","Processing asent: Sharp.\n","Processing asent: Aikam Tsueh.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: Neither of us said anything, so he shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Said he didnt like how it felt; he went out to themilitsya outside, asked them to take a look at it.\n","Processing asent: Pigeonholes covered the walls, and large brown parcels, opened and unopened, lay in corners and plastic bins, on tabletops.\n","Processing asent: Displayed on a stool in the centre, surrounded by ripped envelope and fallen letters trodden with footprints, was a package splayed, electronic innards jutting like wire stamens from a flower.\n","Processing asent: This is the mechanism, the man said.\n","Processing asent: I read the Illitan on his Kevlar: his name was Tairo.\n","Processing asent: He spoke to Dhatt, not me, pointing with a little laser pen, red-dotting what he referred to.\n","Processing asent: Two layers of envelope.\n","Processing asent: Scribbling with the light all over the paper.\n","Processing asent: Open thefirst one, nothing.\n","Processing asent: Insides another one.\n","Processing asent: Openthat Clicked his fingers.\n","Processing asent: Indicating the wires.\n","Processing asent: Nicely done.\n","Processing asent: Classic.\n","Processing asent: Old-fashioned?\n","Processing asent: Nah, just nothing fancy.\n","Processing asent: But nicely done.\n","Processing asent: Not justson et lumiere eitherthis wasnt made to scare someone, it was made to fuck someone up.\n","Processing asent: And I tell you what also.\n","Processing asent: See this?\n","Processing asent: Very directed.\n","Processing asent: Its linked up with the tag.\n","Processing asent: The remnants of it visible in the paper, a red strip on the inner envelope, printed in BesPull here to open .\n","Processing asent: Whoever does is going to get a faceful of bang and fall down.\n","Processing asent: But short of pretty bad luck, anyone standing next to thems only going to need a new hairdo.\n","Processing asent: The blast is directed.\n","Processing asent: Its defused?\n","Processing asent: I asked Tairo.\n","Processing asent: Can I touch it?\n","Processing asent: He did not look at me but at Dhatt, who nodded him to answer.\n","Processing asent: Fingerprints, Tairo said, but shrugged.\n","Processing asent: I took a ballpoint from one of the shelves and took out its cartridge, not to mark anything.\n","Processing asent: I prodded gently at the paper, smoothing down the inner envelope.\n","Processing asent: Even scored open by the defusers, it was easy to read the name written on it: David Bowden.\n","Processing asent: Check this, Tairo said.\n","Processing asent: He rummaged gently.\n","Processing asent: Below the parcel on the inside of the outer envelope, someone had scribbled, in Illitan,The heart of a wolf .\n","Processing asent: I recognised the line but could not place it.\n","Processing asent: Tairo sang it and grinned.\n","Processing asent: Its an old motherland song, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt a scare and it wasnt for generalised mayhem either, Dhatt said to me quietly.\n","Processing asent: We sat in the office we had commandeered.\n","Processing asent: Opposite us, trying politely to avoid eavesdropping, Aikam Tsueh.\n","Processing asent: That was a kill-shot.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck?\n","Processing asent: With Illitan written on it, sent from Besel, I said.\n","Processing asent: Dusting didnt turn anything up.\n","Processing asent: Both envelopes had been scrawled on, the address on the outer and Bowdens name on the inner in a chaotic script.\n","Processing asent: The package was sent from Besel from a post office that was grosstopically not far from the dig itself, though of course the package would have been imported a long way round through Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: Well get the techs on it, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: See if we can trace it backwards, but weve got nothing to point to anyone.\n","Processing asent: Maybe your lotllturn something up.\n","Processing asent: The chances were low to nil we could reconstruct its journey backwards through both the Ul Qoman and Bes postal services.\n","Processing asent: Listen.\n","Processing asent: I made sure Aikam could not hear.\n","Processing asent: We know Mahalia had pissed off some hardcore nats back home.\n","Processing asent: I get it, such organisations cannot possibly exist in Ul Qoma, of course, but if by some inadvertent glitch any of themare out here too, the chances are reasonable that she might have pissed them off too, no?\n","Processing asent: She was mixed up in stuff that could have been designed to annoy them.\n","Processing asent: You know, undermining the power of Ul Qoma, secret groups, porous boundaries, all that.\n","Processing asent: You know.\n","Processing asent: He watched me without expression.\n","Processing asent: Right, he said eventually.\n","Processing asent: Two out of two students with special interests in Orciny are out of the picture.\n","Processing asent: And now weve got a bomb to Mr.Between Cities.\n","Processing asent: We looked at each other.\n","Processing asent: After a moment, louder now, I said, Well done, Aikam.\n","Processing asent: That was really something that you did.\n","Processing asent: Have you held a bomb before, Aikam?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Not in national service?\n","Processing asent: I havent done mine yet, Officer.\n","Processing asent: So how do you know what a bomb feels like?\n","Processing asent: Shrug.\n","Processing asent: I didnt, I dont, I just It was wrong.\n","Processing asent: Too heavy.\n","Processing asent: I bet this place gets a lot of books in the mail, I said.\n","Processing asent: Maybe computer stuff too.\n","Processing asent: Theyre pretty heavy.\n","Processing asent: How did you know this was different?\n","Processing asent: Different heavy.\n","Processing asent: It was harder.\n","Processing asent: Under the envelopes.\n","Processing asent: You could tell it wasnt paper, it was like metal or something.\n","Processing asent: Matter of fact is it even your job to be checking mail?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: No, but I was in there, just because.\n","Processing asent: I was thinking that I could bring it out.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to, and then I felt that one and it was there was something about it.\n","Processing asent: You have good instincts.\n","Processing asent: Thank you.\n","Processing asent: Did you think about opening it?\n","Processing asent: It wasnt to me.\n","Processing asent: Who was it to?\n","Processing asent: It wasnt to anyone.\n","Processing asent: That outer envelope had named no recipient, only the dig.\n","Processing asent: Thats another reason, thats why I looked at it, maybe, because I thought that was weird.\n","Processing asent: We conferred.\n","Processing asent: Okay, Aikam, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: You gave your address to the other officer, in case we need to get hold of you again?\n","Processing asent: When you go out would you send in your boss and Professor Nancy, please?\n","Processing asent: He hesitated in the doorway.\n","Processing asent: Do you have any information about Geary yet?\n","Processing asent: Do you know what happened yet?\n","Processing asent: Who killed her?\n","Processing asent: We told him no.\n","Processing asent: Kai Buidze, the chief guard, a muscular fifty-year-old, ex-army Id guess, came in with Isabelle Nancy.\n","Processing asent: She, not Rochambeaux, had offered her help in any way she could.\n","Processing asent: She was rubbing her eyes.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Bowden?\n","Processing asent: I said to Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Does he know?\n","Processing asent: She called him when the bomb squad opened the outer envelope and there was his name.\n","Processing asent: He nodded at Nancy.\n","Processing asent: She heard one of them reading it out.\n","Processing asent: Someones gone to get him.\n","Processing asent: Professor Nancy.\n","Processing asent: She looked up.\n","Processing asent: Does Bowden get a lot of mail here?\n","Processing asent: Not so much.\n","Processing asent: He doesnt even have an office.\n","Processing asent: But a bit.\n","Processing asent: Quite a lot from foreigners, a few from prospective students, people who dont know where he lives or who assume hes based here.\n","Processing asent: Do you send it on?\n","Processing asent: No, he comes in to check it every few days.\n","Processing asent: Throws most of it away.\n","Processing asent: Someones really I said quietly to Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Hesitated.\n","Processing asent: Trying to outrun us, know what were doing.\n","Processing asent: With everything that was happening, Bowden might be wary now of any packages to his home.\n","Processing asent: With the outer envelope and its foreign postmark discarded, he might even have thought something with only his name written on it an internal communication, something from one of his colleagues, and torn the strip.\n","Processing asent: Like someone knew hed been warned to be careful.\n","Processing asent: After a moment I said, Theyre bringing him in?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt nodded.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Buidze, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: You had any trouble like this before?\n","Processing asent: Not like this.\n","Processing asent: Sure, we get, you know, we had some letters from fuckups.\n","Processing asent: Excuse me.\n","Processing asent: A glance at an unruffled Nancy.\n","Processing asent: But you know, we get warnings from Leave-the-Past-Alone types, people who say were betraying Ul Qoma, all that shit, UFO watchers and junkies.\n","Processing asent: But an actual butthis?\n","Processing asent: A bomb?\n","Processing asent: He shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Thats not true, Nancy said.\n","Processing asent: We stared at her.\n","Processing asent: This happened before.\n","Processing asent: Not here.\n","Processing asent: But to him.\n","Processing asent: Bowdens been targeted before.\n","Processing asent: Who by?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: They never proved anything, but he got a lot of people angry when his book came out.\n","Processing asent: The right.\n","Processing asent: People who thought he was disrespectful.\n","Processing asent: Nats, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: I dont even remember which city it was from.\n","Processing asent: Both lots had it in for him.\n","Processing asent: Probably the only thing they agreed on.\n","Processing asent: But this wasyears ago.\n","Processing asent: Someones remembered him, I said.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt and I stared at each other and he pulled me aside.\n","Processing asent: FromBesel, he said.\n","Processing asent: With a littleIllitan fuck-you on it.\n","Processing asent: He threw up his hands:Any ideas?\n","Processing asent: Whats the name of those people?\n","Processing asent: I said after a silence.\n","Processing asent: Qoma First.\n","Processing asent: He stared.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: Qoma First?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: It came fromBesel.\n","Processing asent: Maybe a contact there.\n","Processing asent: A spy?\n","Processing asent: A nat Qoman in Besel?\n","Processing asent: Sure.\n","Processing asent: Dont look like thatits not so hard to believe.\n","Processing asent: Theyd send it from over there to cover their tracks.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt wagged his head noncommittally.\n","Processing asent: Okay he said.\n","Processing asent: Still a hell of a thing to organize, and youre not\n","Processing asent: They never liked Bowden.\n","Processing asent: Maybe they figure if hes got wind that theyre after him he might have alarm bells, butnot with a package from Besel, I said.\n","Processing asent: I get the idea, he said.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Qoma First hang out?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Thats what theyre called, right?\n","Processing asent: Maybe we should visit\n","Processing asent: Thats what I keep trying to tell you, he said.\n","Processing asent: Theres nowhereto go.\n","Processing asent: There is no Qoma First, not like that.\n","Processing asent: I dont know how it is in Besel, but here\n","Processing asent: In Besel I know exactly where our own versions of these characters hang out.\n","Processing asent: Me and my constable went round there recently.\n","Processing asent: Well congratulations but it doesnt work that way here.\n","Processing asent: Theres not like a fuckinggang with little membership cards and a house they all live in; theyre not unifs and theyre not The Monkees.\n","Processing asent: Youre not saying youve got no ultranationalists\n","Processing asent: Right, Imnot saying that, weve got plenty, but Im saying I dont know who they are or where they live, very sensibly they keep it that way, and Im saying Qoma Firsts just a term some press guy came up with.\n","Processing asent: How come the unificationists congregate but this lot dont?\n","Processing asent: Or cant?\n","Processing asent: Because the unifs are clowns.\n","Processing asent: Dangerous clowns sometimes, alright, but still.\n","Processing asent: The sort of people youre talking about now are serious.\n","Processing asent: Old soldiers, that sort of thing.\n","Processing asent: I mean you got to respect that\n","Processing asent: No wonder they could not be allowed to gather visibly.\n","Processing asent: Their hard nationalism might rebuke the Peoples National Party on its own terms, which the rulers would not permit.\n","Processing asent: The unifs, by contrast, were free or free-ish to unite the locals in loathing.\n","Processing asent: What can you tell us about him?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt said, raising his voice to the others who watched us.\n","Processing asent: Aikam?\n","Processing asent: Buidze said.\n","Processing asent: Nothing.\n","Processing asent: Good worker.\n","Processing asent: Dumb as a brick.\n","Processing asent: Okay look, Id have said that until today, but given what he just did, scratch that.\n","Processing asent: Not nearly as tough as he looks.\n","Processing asent: All pecs and no teeth, that one.\n","Processing asent: Likes the kids, makes him feel good to hobnob with clever foreigners.\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: Tell me youre not eye-balling him, SD.\n","Processing asent: That parcel came fromBesel .\n","Processing asent: How the hell would he\n","Processing asent: Absolutely it did, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: No one heres accusing anyone, least of all the hero of the hour.\n","Processing asent: Standard questions.\n","Processing asent: Tsueh got on with the students, you said?\n","Processing asent: Unlike Tairo, Buidze did not look for permission to answer me.\n","Processing asent: He met my eyeand nodded.\n","Processing asent: Anyone in particular?\n","Processing asent: Good friends with Mahalia Geary?\n","Processing asent: Geary?\n","Processing asent: Hell no.\n","Processing asent: Geary probably never even knew his name.\n","Processing asent: Rest her.\n","Processing asent: He made the Sign of Long Sleep with his hand.\n","Processing asent: Aikams friends with some of them, but not Geary.\n","Processing asent: He hangs out with Jacobs, Smith, Rodriguez, Browning\n","Processing asent: Just that he asked us\n","Processing asent: He was very keen to know about any leads in the Geary case, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Yeah?\n","Processing asent: Buidze shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Well that got everyone really upset.\n","Processing asent: Of course he wants to know about it.\n","Processing asent: Im wondering I said.\n","Processing asent: This is a complicated site, and I notice that even though its mostly total, theres a couple of places where it crosshatches a bit.\n","Processing asent: And thats got to be a nightmare to watch.\n","Processing asent: Mr. Buidze, when we spoke to the students, not a single one of them mentioned Breach.\n","Processing asent: At all.\n","Processing asent: Didnt bring it up.\n","Processing asent: A group of foreign kids?\n","Processing asent: You know how much foreigners are obsessed with that stuff.\n","Processing asent: One of their friends is disappeared and theyre not even mentioning the most notorious bogeyman of Ul Qoma and Besel, which is evenreal , and they dont mention it?\n","Processing asent: Which couldnt help but make us wonder what are they afraid of?\n","Processing asent: Buidze stared at me.\n","Processing asent: He glanced at Nancy.\n","Processing asent: He looked around the room.\n","Processing asent: After long seconds he laughed.\n","Processing asent: Youre joking.\n","Processing asent: Okay then.\n","Processing asent: Alright then, Officers.\n","Processing asent: Yeah theyre scared alright, but not that someones breaching from fuck knows where to mess with them.\n","Processing asent: Is that what youre thinking?\n","Processing asent: He shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Theyre scared because they dont want to get caught.\n","Processing asent: He held up his hands in surrender.\n","Processing asent: Youve got me, Officers.\n","Processing asent: Thereis breaching going on that were not able to stop.\n","Processing asent: These little sods breach all the damn time.\n","Processing asent: He met our stares.\n","Processing asent: Not defensive.\n","Processing asent: He was matter-of-fact.\n","Processing asent: Did I look as shocked as Dhatt?\n","Processing asent: Professor Nancys expression was if anything embarrassed.\n","Processing asent: Youre right, of course, Buidze said.\n","Processing asent: You cant avoid all breach, not in a place like this, and not with kids like these.\n","Processing asent: These arent locals, and I dont care how much training you give them, theyvenever seen anything like this before.\n","Processing asent: Dont tell me its not the same back in your place, Borl.\n","Processing asent: You think theyre going to play loyal?\n","Processing asent: You think while they wander around town theyrereally unseeing Besel?\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Best any of us can hope fors theyve got the sense not to make a big thing of it, but ofcourse theyre seeing across the border.\n","Processing asent: No we cant prove it, which is why Breach wouldnt come unless they really fuck up.\n","Processing asent: Oh its happened.\n","Processing asent: But much rarer than you think.\n","Processing asent: Not for a long time.\n","Processing asent: Professor Nancy still looked down at the table.\n","Processing asent: You thinkany of the foreigners dont breach?\n","Processing asent: Buidze said, and leaned in towards us, spreading his fingers.\n","Processing asent: All we can get from thems a bit of politeness, right?\n","Processing asent: And when you get a bunch of young people together, theyre going to push it.\n","Processing asent: Maybe its not just looks.\n","Processing asent: Did you always do what youre told?\n","Processing asent: But these are smart kids.\n","Processing asent: He sketched maps on the table with his fingertips.\n","Processing asent: Bol Yean crosshatcheshere, here , and the park its inhere andhere .\n","Processing asent: And yeah, over at the edges in this direction, it even creeps into Besel total.\n","Processing asent: So when this lot get drunk or whatever, dont they egg each other on to go stand in a crosshatch bit of the park?\n","Processing asent: And then, who knows if they dont, maybe standing still there, without a single word, without even moving, cross over into Besel, then back again?\n","Processing asent: You dont have to take a step to do that, not if youre in a crosshatch.\n","Processing asent: All here.\n","Processing asent: Tapped his forehead.\n","Processing asent: No one can prove shit.\n","Processing asent: Then maybe next time when theyre doing that they reach down, grab a souvenir, straighten back up into Ul Qoma with a rock from Besel or something.\n","Processing asent: If thats where they were when they picked it up, thats where its from, right?\n","Processing asent: Who knows?\n","Processing asent: Who could prove it?\n","Processing asent: So long as they dont flaunt it, what can you do?\n","Processing asent: Even Breach cant watch for breach all the time.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: If they did, not a single one of this foreign lot would still be here.\n","Processing asent: Isnt that right, Professor?\n","Processing asent: He looked at her not unkindly.\n","Processing asent: She said nothing but looked at me in embarrassment.\n","Processing asent: None of them mentioned Breach, SD Dhatt, because theyre all guilty as hell.\n","Processing asent: Buidze smiled.\n","Processing asent: Hey, dont get me wrong: theyre only human, I like them.\n","Processing asent: But dont make this more than it is.\n","Processing asent: As we ushered them out, Dhatt got a call that had him scribbling notes and muttering.\n","Processing asent: I closed the door.\n","Processing asent: That was one of the uniforms we sent to get Bowden.\n","Processing asent: Hes gone.\n","Processing asent: They got to his apartment and no ones answering.\n","Processing asent: Hes not there.\n","Processing asent: They told him they were coming?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, and he knew about the bomb.\n","Processing asent: But hes gone.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Eighteen\n","Processing asent: I WANT TO GO BACK AND TALKto that kid again, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: The unificationist?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, Jaris.\n","Processing asent: I know, I know, It wasnt him.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: You said.\n","Processing asent: Well, whatever, he knows something and I want to talk to him.\n","Processing asent: You wont find him.\n","Processing asent: Good luck.\n","Processing asent: Hes gone.\n","Processing asent: He fell behind me a few steps and made a phone call.\n","Processing asent: Youre right.\n","Processing asent: Jaris is nowhere.\n","Processing asent: How did you know?\n","Processing asent: What the fuck are you playing at?\n","Processing asent: Lets go to your office.\n","Processing asent: Fuck the office.\n","Processing asent: The office can wait.\n","Processing asent: Repeat, how the fuck did you know about Jaris?\n","Processing asent: Im getting a bit spooked by your occult abilities, Borl.\n","Processing asent: I didnt sit on my arsewhen I heard Id be babysitting you, I looked you up, so I know a little bit, I know youre no one to fuck with.\n","Processing asent: Im sure you did the same, so you know the same.\n","Processing asent: I should have done.\n","Processing asent: So I was geared up to be working with a detective.\n","Processing asent: Even some hot shit.\n","Processing asent: I wasnt expecting this lugubrious tutting bugger.\n","Processing asent: How the fuck did you know about Jaris, and why are youprotecting that little shit?\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: He phoned me last night from a car or I think from the train and told me he was going.\n","Processing asent: He stared at me.\n","Processing asent: Why the fuck did he callyou?\n","Processing asent: And why the fuck did you not tell me?\n","Processing asent: Are we working together or not, Borl?\n","Processing asent: Why did he call me?\n","Processing asent: Maybe he wasnt bananas about your interrogation style, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: And are we working together?\n","Processing asent: I thought the reason I was here was to obediently give you everything Ive got, then watch TV in my hotel room while you find the bad guy.\n","Processing asent: When did Bowden get burgled?\n","Processing asent: When were you going to tell me that?\n","Processing asent: I didnt see you rushing to spill whatever shit you found out from UlHuan at the dig, and he should have the choicest infoheis the bloody government mole, isnt he?\n","Processing asent: Come on, its no big deal, all public works have them.\n","Processing asent: What I object to is you cutting me out then coming the How could you?\n","Processing asent: We stared at each other.\n","Processing asent: After a long moment he turned and walked to the kerb.\n","Processing asent: Put out a warrant for Jaris, I said to his back.\n","Processing asent: Put a stop on his passports, inform the airports, stations.\n","Processing asent: But he only called me because he was en route, to tell me what he thinks happened.\n","Processing asent: His phones probably smashed up by the tracks in the middle of Cucinis Pass, halfway to the Balkans by now.\n","Processing asent: So what is it hethinks happened?\n","Processing asent: He turned in disgust and waved the word away.\n","Processing asent: Were you even going to fucking tell me this?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: I told you, didnt I?\n","Processing asent: Hes just done a runner.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt that tell you anything?\n","Processing asent: The goddamnguilty run.\n","Processing asent: What, you talking about Mahalia?\n","Processing asent: Come on, whats his motive?\n","Processing asent: I said that but remembered some of what Jaris had told me.\n","Processing asent: She had not been one of their party.\n","Processing asent: They had driven her out.\n","Processing asent: I hesitated a little.\n","Processing asent: Or you mean Bowden?\n","Processing asent: Why the hell andhow the hell would Jaris organise something like that?\n","Processing asent: I dont know, both.\n","Processing asent: Who knows what makes these fuckers do what they do?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Therell be some fucked-up justification or other, some conspiracy thing.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt make sense, I said carefully, after a minute.\n","Processing asent: It was Okay, it was him who called me from here in the first place.\n","Processing asent: Iknew it.\n","Processing asent: You fuckingcovered for him\n","Processing asent: I didnt know.\n","Processing asent: I couldnt tell.\n","Processing asent: When he called last night he told me.\n","Processing asent: Wait, wait, listen, Dhatt: why would he call me in the first place if it was him who killed her?\n","Processing asent: He stared at me.\n","Processing asent: After a minute he turned and hailed a cab.\n","Processing asent: He opened its door.\n","Processing asent: I watched.\n","Processing asent: The cab had halted skew-whiff on the road: Ul Qoman cars sounded their horns as they went past, Bes drivers cut quietly around the protub, the law-abiding not even whispering cusses.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt stood there half-in, half-out, and the cabbie made some remonstrance.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt snapped something and showed him his ID.\n","Processing asent: I dont know why, he said to me.\n","Processing asent: Something to find out.\n","Processing asent: But its a bit fucking much, isnt it?\n","Processing asent: That hes gone?\n","Processing asent: If he was in on it theres no sense him drawing my attention toanything .\n","Processing asent: And hows he supposed to have got her to Besel?\n","Processing asent: Called his friends over there; they did it\n","Processing asent: I shrugged a doubtingmaybe .\n","Processing asent: It was the Bes unifs who gave us our first lead on all this, guy called Drodin.\n","Processing asent: Ive heard of misdirection, but we didnt have anything to misdirect.\n","Processing asent: They dont have the smarts or contacts to know which van to stealnot the ones Ive met.\n","Processing asent: Plus theres morepoliczai agents than members on their books anyway.\n","Processing asent: If this was unifs it was some secret hardcore weve not seen.\n","Processing asent: I spoke to Jaris Hes scared, I said.\n","Processing asent: Not guilty: scared and sad.\n","Processing asent: He was into her, I think.\n","Processing asent: Alright, Dhatt said after a while.\n","Processing asent: He looked at me, motioned me into the cab.\n","Processing asent: He stayed standing outside for several seconds, giving orders into his phone too quiet and quick for me to follow.\n","Processing asent: Alright.\n","Processing asent: Lets change the record.\n","Processing asent: He spoke slowly as the cab drove.\n","Processing asent: Who gives a fuck whats gone down between Besel and Ul Qoma, right?\n","Processing asent: Who gives a fuck what my boss is telling me or what yours is telling you?\n","Processing asent: Youre police.\n","Processing asent: Im police.\n","Processing asent: Lets fix this.\n","Processing asent: Are weworking together, Borl?\n","Processing asent: I could do with some help on a case thats getting more fucked by the minute, how about you?\n","Processing asent: UlHuan doesnt know fuck, by the way.\n","Processing asent: Where he took me, a place very close to his office, was not as dark as a cop bar in Besel would have been.\n","Processing asent: It was more salubrious.\n","Processing asent: I still would not have booked a wedding reception there.\n","Processing asent: It was, if only just, during working hours, but the room was more than half-full.\n","Processing asent: It cannot have all been localmilitsya , but I recognised many of the faces from Dhatts office.\n","Processing asent: They recognised me, too.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt entered to greetings, and I followed him past whispers and those so-charmingly frank Ul Qoman stares.\n","Processing asent: One definite murder and now two disappearances, I said.\n","Processing asent: I watched him very carefully.\n","Processing asent: All people who are known to have looked at this stuff.\n","Processing asent: There is no fucking Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, Im not saying that.\n","Processing asent: You said yourself there are such things as cults and lunatics.\n","Processing asent: Seriously fuck off.\n","Processing asent: The most culty lunatic weve met just fled the scene of the crime, and you gave him a free pass.\n","Processing asent: I should have said first thing this morning, I apologise.\n","Processing asent: You shouldve called last night.\n","Processing asent: Even if we could find him I thought we didnt have enough to hold him.\n","Processing asent: But I apologise.\n","Processing asent: Held my hands open.\n","Processing asent: I stared at him some time.\n","Processing asent: He was overcoming something.\n","Processing asent: I want to solve this, he said.\n","Processing asent: The pleasant burr of Illitan from the customers.\n","Processing asent: I heard the clucks as one or two saw my visitors mark.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt bought me a beer.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoman, flavoured with all kinds of whatnot.\n","Processing asent: It would not be winter for weeks, and though it was no colder in Ul Qoma than in Besel, it felt colder to me.\n","Processing asent: What do you say?\n","Processing asent: If you wont even fucking trust me\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, Ive already told you stuff that I lowered my voice.\n","Processing asent: No one else knows about thatfirst phone call.\n","Processing asent: I dont know whats going on.\n","Processing asent: I dont understand any of this.\n","Processing asent: Im not solving anything.\n","Processing asent: Im by some fluke that I do not know the whys of any more than you, being used.\n","Processing asent: For some reason Ive been a repository for a bunch of information that I dont know what to do with.\n","Processing asent: I hopetheres ayet after that, but I dont know, just like I dont know anything.\n","Processing asent: What doesJaris think happened?\n","Processing asent: Im going to track that fucker down.\n","Processing asent: He would not.\n","Processing asent: I shouldve called, but I could Hes not our guy.\n","Processing asent: You know, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: You know.\n","Processing asent: How long you been an officer?\n","Processing asent: Sometimes youknow , right?\n","Processing asent: I tapped my chest.\n","Processing asent: I was right, he liked that, nodded.\n","Processing asent: I told him what Jaris had said.\n","Processing asent: Fucking crap, he said, when I was done.\n","Processing asent: What the fuckis this Orciny stuff?Thats what he was running from?\n","Processing asent: Youre reading that book.\n","Processing asent: The dodgy one Bowden wrote.\n","Processing asent: Whats it like?\n","Processing asent: Theres a lot in it.\n","Processing asent: A lot of stuff.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: Of course its ludicrous, like you say.\n","Processing asent: Secret overlords behind the scene, more powerful even than Breach, puppetmasters, hidden cities.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, but the point is that its crap a bunch of people believe.\n","Processing asent: AndI opened my hands at himsomething bigs going on, and we have no idea what it is.\n","Processing asent: Maybe Ill take a look at it after you, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Who the fuck knows anything.\n","Processing asent: He said the last word carefully.\n","Processing asent: Qussim.\n","Processing asent: A couple of his colleagues, men of about his age or mine, raising their glasses to him, just about to me.\n","Processing asent: There was something in their eyes, they were moving in like curious animals.\n","Processing asent: Qussim, weve not had a chance to meet our guest.\n","Processing asent: Youve been hiding him away.\n","Processing asent: Yura, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Kai.\n","Processing asent: Hows tricks?\n","Processing asent: Borl, these are detectives blah and blah.\n","Processing asent: He waved his hands between them and me.\n","Processing asent: One of them raised his eyebrow at Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: I just wanted to find out how Inspector Borl was finding Ul Qoma, the one called Kai said.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt snorted and finished his beer.\n","Processing asent: Fucks sake, he said.\n","Processing asent: He sounded as amused as angry.\n","Processing asent: You want to get drunk and get into an argument with him, maybe even if youre far gone enough, Yura, a fight.\n","Processing asent: Youll bring up all manner ofunfortunate international incidents.\n","Processing asent: The fucking war might get dusted off.\n","Processing asent: You might even say something about your dad.\n","Processing asent: His dad was in the UQ Navy, he said to me.\n","Processing asent: Got tinnitus or some shit in a fucking idiots skirmish with a Bes tugboat over some disputed lobster pots or whatever.\n","Processing asent: I glanced, but neither of our interlocutors looked particularly outraged.\n","Processing asent: There was even a trace of humour on Kais face.\n","Processing asent: Ill save you the trouble, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Hes as much of a Bes wanker as you think, and you can spread that around the office.\n","Processing asent: Come on, Borl.\n","Processing asent: We went via his stations garage and he picked up his car.\n","Processing asent: Hey He indicated me the steering wheel.\n","Processing asent: It never even occurred to me, maybe you want to give the Ul Qoman roads a go.\n","Processing asent: No, thanks.\n","Processing asent: I think it would be a bit confusing.\n","Processing asent: Driving in Besel or Ul Qoma is hard enough when you are in your home city, negotiating local and foreign traffic.\n","Processing asent: You know, I said.\n","Processing asent: When I was first driving it must be the same here, as well as seeing all the cars on the road youve got to learn to unsee all the other cars, the ones abroad, but unsee them fast enough to get out of their way.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt nodded.\n","Processing asent: Anyway, when I was a kid first driving we had to get used to zooming past all these old bangers and stuff in Ul Qoma, donkey carts in some parts and what have you.\n","Processing asent: That you unsaw, but you know Now years later most of the unseens have been overtaking me.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt laughed.\n","Processing asent: Almost embarrassed.\n","Processing asent: Things go up and down, he said.\n","Processing asent: Ten years from now itll be you lot doing the overtaking again.\n","Processing asent: Come on, he said.\n","Processing asent: Itll shift; it always does.\n","Processing asent: Its already started.\n","Processing asent: Our expos?\n","Processing asent: A couple of little pity investments.\n","Processing asent: I think youll be top wolf for a while.\n","Processing asent: Were blockaded!\n","Processing asent: Not that you seem to be doing too bad on it.\n","Processing asent: Washington loves us, and all weve got to show for it is Coke.\n","Processing asent: Dont knock that, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Have you tasted Canuck Cola?\n","Processing asent: All this is old Cold War bullshit.\n","Processing asent: Who gives a fuck who the Americans want to play with, anyway?\n","Processing asent: Good luck with them.OhCanada He sang the line.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt said to me, Whats the food like at that place?\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: Bad.\n","Processing asent: No worse than any other hotel food.\n","Processing asent: He yanked the wheel, took us off the route Id come to know.\n","Processing asent: Sweet?\n","Processing asent: he said into his phone.\n","Processing asent: Can you chuck some more stuff on for supper?\n","Processing asent: Thanks, beautiful.\n","Processing asent: I want you to meet my new partner.\n","Processing asent: Her name was Yallya.\n","Processing asent: She was pretty, quite a lot younger than Dhatt, but she greeted me very poised, playing a role and enjoying it, waiting at the door of their apartment to triple-kiss me hello, the Ul Qoman way.\n","Processing asent: On the way to the house, Dhatt had looked at me and said You okay?\n","Processing asent: It was quickly obvious that he lived within a mile, in grosstopic terms, of my own house.\n","Processing asent: From their living room I saw that Dhatt and Yallyas rooms and my own overlooked the same stretch of green ground, that in Besel was Majdlyna Green and in Ul Qoma was Kwaidso Park, a finely balanced crosshatch.\n","Processing asent: I had walked in Majdlyna myself often.\n","Processing asent: There are parts where even individual trees are crosshatched, where Ul Qoman children and Bes children clamber past each other, each obeying their parents whispered strictures to unsee the other.\n","Processing asent: Children are sacks of infection.\n","Processing asent: That was the sort of thing that spread diseases.\n","Processing asent: Epidemiology was always complicated here and back home.\n","Processing asent: How you liking Ul Qoma, Inspector?\n","Processing asent: Tyador.\n","Processing asent: Very much.\n","Processing asent: Bullshit, he thinks were all thugs and idiots and being invaded by secret armies from hidden cities.\n","Processing asent: Dhatts laughter was not without edge.\n","Processing asent: Anyway were not getting much chance to exactly go sightseeing.\n","Processing asent: Hows the case?\n","Processing asent: There is no case, he told her.\n","Processing asent: Theres a series of random and implausible crises that make no sense other than if you believe the most dramatic possible shit.\n","Processing asent: And theres a dead girl at the end of it all.\n","Processing asent: Is that true?\n","Processing asent: she said to me.\n","Processing asent: They were bringing out food in bits and pieces.\n","Processing asent: It was not home cooking, and seemed to include a lot ofconvenience and prepackaged food, but it was better quality than Id been eating, and was more Ul Qoman, though that is not an unmitigated good.\n","Processing asent: The sky darkened over the crosshatched park, with night and with wet clouds.\n","Processing asent: You miss potatoes, Yallya said.\n","Processing asent: Is it written on my face?\n","Processing asent: Its all you eat, isnt it?\n","Processing asent: She thought she was being playful.\n","Processing asent: This too spicy for you?\n","Processing asent: Theres someone watching us from the park.\n","Processing asent: How can you tell from here?\n","Processing asent: She glanced over my shoulder.\n","Processing asent: Hope for their sake theyre in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: She was an editor at a financial magazine and had, judging by the books I saw and the posters in the bathroom, a taste for Japanese comics.\n","Processing asent: Are you married, Tyador?\n","Processing asent: I tried to answer Yallyas questions though they came too fast really for that.\n","Processing asent: Is this the first time youve been here?\n","Processing asent: No, but the first time for a long time.\n","Processing asent: So you dont know it.\n","Processing asent: I might once have claimed to know London, but not for years.\n","Processing asent: Youre well travelled!\n","Processing asent: And now with all this are you mixing with insiles and breachers?\n","Processing asent: I did not find this line adorable.\n","Processing asent: Qussim says youre spending your time where theyre digging up old hex stuff.\n","Processing asent: Its like most places, much more bureaucratic than it sounds, no matter how weird the stories are.\n","Processing asent: Its ridiculous.\n","Processing asent: She looked contrite, quite suddenly.\n","Processing asent: I shouldnt make jokes about it.\n","Processing asent: Its just because I dont know almost anything about the girl who died.\n","Processing asent: You never ask, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: Well, its Do you have a picture of her?\n","Processing asent: Yallya said.\n","Processing asent: I must have looked surprised because Dhatt shrugged at me. I reached into my inner pocket jacket, but remembered when I touched it that the only picture I hada small copy of a copy taken in Besel, tucked into my walletwas of Mahalia dead.\n","Processing asent: I would not show that.\n","Processing asent: Im sorry, I dont.\n","Processing asent: In the little quiet it occurred to me that Mahalia was only a few years younger than Yallya.\n","Processing asent: I stayed longer than I had expected.\n","Processing asent: She was a good host, particularly when I got her off this stuffshe let me steer the conversation away.\n","Processing asent: I watched her and Dhatt perform gentle bickering.\n","Processing asent: The proximity of the park and of other peoples affection was moving, to the point of distracting.\n","Processing asent: Watching Yallya and Dhatt made me think of Sariska and Biszaya.\n","Processing asent: I recalled the odd eagerness of Aikam Tsueh.\n","Processing asent: When I left, Dhatt took me down to the street and headed for the car, but I said to him, Ill make my own way.\n","Processing asent: He stared.\n","Processing asent: Are you okay?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: Youve been funny all night.\n","Processing asent: Im fine, sorry.\n","Processing asent: Im sorry, I dont mean to be rude; it was very kind of you.\n","Processing asent: Really it was a good night, and Yallya youre a lucky man. I just, Im trying to think things through.\n","Processing asent: Look, Im okay to go.\n","Processing asent: Ive money.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoman money.\n","Processing asent: I showed him my wallet.\n","Processing asent: Ive got all my papers.\n","Processing asent: Visitors badge.\n","Processing asent: I know it makes you uncomfortable having me out and about, but seriously, Id like to walk; I need to be out for a bit.\n","Processing asent: Its a beautiful night.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck are you talking about?\n","Processing asent: Its raining.\n","Processing asent: I like rain.\n","Processing asent: Anyway, this is drizzle.\n","Processing asent: You wouldnt last a day in Besel.\n","Processing asent: We getreal rain in Besel.\n","Processing asent: An old joke but he smiled and surrendered.\n","Processing asent: Whatever.\n","Processing asent: We have to work this out, you know; were not getting very far.\n","Processing asent: And us the best minds our cities have, right?\n","Processing asent: And Yolanda Rodriguez remains unfound, and now weve lost Bowden, too.\n","Processing asent: Were not going to win medals for this.\n","Processing asent: He looked around.\n","Processing asent: Seriously, what is going on?\n","Processing asent: You know everything I know, I said.\n","Processing asent: What bugs me, he said, isnt that theres no way to make sense of this shit.\n","Processing asent: Its that thereis a way to make sense of it.\n","Processing asent: And its not a way I want to go.\n","Processing asent: I dont believe in He waved at malevolent hidden cities.\n","Processing asent: He stared the length of his street.\n","Processing asent: It was total, so none of the lights from windows above was foreign.\n","Processing asent: It was not so late, and we were not alone.\n","Processing asent: People were silhouetted by the lights of a road perpendicular to Dhatts street, a road mostly in Besel.\n","Processing asent: For a momentI thought one of the black figures had, for seconds long enough to constitute breach, watched us, but then they moved on.\n","Processing asent: When I started walking, watching the wet-edged shapes of the city, I was not going anywhere in particular.\n","Processing asent: I was moving south.\n","Processing asent: Walking alone past people who were not, I indulged the idea of walking to where Sariska or Biszaya lived, or even Corwisomething of that melancholy connection.\n","Processing asent: They knew I was in Ul Qoma: I could find them and could walk alongside them in the street and we would be inches apart but unable to acknowledge each other.\n","Processing asent: Like the old story.\n","Processing asent: Not that I would ever do such a thing.\n","Processing asent: Having to unsee acquaintances or friends is a rare and notoriously uncomfortable circumstance.\n","Processing asent: What I did do was walk past my own house.\n","Processing asent: I half expected to see one of my neighbours, none of whom, I think, knew I was abroad, and who might therefore be expected to greet me before noticing my Ul Qoman visitors badge and hurriedly attempting to unbreach.\n","Processing asent: Their lights were on, but they were all indoors.\n","Processing asent: In Ul Qoma I was in Ioy Street.\n","Processing asent: It is pretty equally crosshatched with RosidStrsz where I lived.\n","Processing asent: The building two doors along from my own house was a late-night Ul Qoman liquor store, half the pedestrians around me in Ul Qoma, so I was able to stop grosstopically, physically close to my own front door, and unsee it of course, but equally of course not quite, with an emotion the name of which I have no idea.\n","Processing asent: I came slowly closer, keeping my eyes on the entrances in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Someone was watching me.\n","Processing asent: It looked like an old woman.\n","Processing asent: I could hardly see her in the dark, certainly not her face in any detail, but something was curious in the way she stood.\n","Processing asent: I took in her clothes and could not tell which city she was in.\n","Processing asent: That is a common instant of uncertainty, but this one went on for much longer than usual.\n","Processing asent: And my alarm did not subside, it grew, as her locus refused to clarify.\n","Processing asent: I saw others in similar shadows, similarly hard to make sense of, emerging, sort of, not approaching me, not even moving but holding themselves so they grew more in focus.\n","Processing asent: The woman continuedto stare at me, and she took a step or two in my direction, so either she was in Ul Qoma or breaching.\n","Processing asent: That made me step back.\n","Processing asent: I kept backing away.\n","Processing asent: There was an ugly pause, until as if in belated echo she and those others did the same, and were gone suddenly into shared dark.\n","Processing asent: I got out of there, not quite running but fast.\n","Processing asent: I found better-lit avenues.\n","Processing asent: I did not walk straight to the hotel.\n","Processing asent: After my heart had slowed and I had spent some minutes in a not-empty spot, I walked to the same vantage point I had taken before, overlooking Bol Yean.\n","Processing asent: I was much more careful in my scrutiny than I had been, and tried to affect Ul Qoman bearing, and for the hour I watched that unlit excavation, nomilitsya came.\n","Processing asent: So far they tended to be either violently present or altogether absent.\n","Processing asent: Doubtless there was a method of ensuring subtle intervention from the Ul Qoman police, but I did not know it.\n","Processing asent: At the Hilton I requested a 5 a.m. wakeup call, and asked the woman behind the desk if she would print me up a message, as the tiny room called a business centre was closed.\n","Processing asent: First she did so on marked Hilton paper.\n","Processing asent: Would you mind doing it on plain?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I winked.\n","Processing asent: Just in case its intercepted.\n","Processing asent: She smiled, not sure what intimacy it was she was privy to.\n","Processing asent: Can you read that back to me?\n","Processing asent: Urgent.\n","Processing asent: Come ASAP.\n","Processing asent: Dont call.\n","Processing asent: I was back overlooking the site the next morning, having taken a circuitous walked route through the city.\n","Processing asent: Though as law demanded I wore my visitors mark, I had placed it at the very edge of my lapel, where cloth folded, only visible to those who knew to look.\n","Processing asent: I wore it on a jacket that was a genuine Ul Qoman design and was, like my hat, not new but new to me. I had set out some hours before any shops were open, but a surprised Ul Qoman man at the farthest reach of my walk was several dinar richer and lighter his outer clothes.\n","Processing asent: Nothing guaranteed that I was not watched, but I did not think I was by themilitsya .\n","Processing asent: It was not long after dawn, but Ul Qomans were everywhere.\n","Processing asent: I would not risk walking closer to Bol Yean.\n","Processing asent: As the morning wore on the city filled with hundreds of children: those in the strict Ul Qoman school uniforms, and dozens of street children.I attempted to be moderately unobtrusive, watched from behind the overlong headlines of theUl Qoma Nasyona , eating fried street food for breakfast.\n","Processing asent: People began to arrive at the dig.\n","Processing asent: Arriving often in little groups, they were too far away for me to tell who was who as they entered, showing their passes.\n","Processing asent: I waited a while.\n","Processing asent: The little girl I approached in her outsized trainers and cutoff jeans looked at me sceptically.\n","Processing asent: I held up a five-dinar note and a sealed envelope.\n","Processing asent: You see that place?\n","Processing asent: You see the gate?\n","Processing asent: She nodded, guarded.\n","Processing asent: They were opportunist couriers, these kids, among everything else.\n","Processing asent: Where you from?\n","Processing asent: she said.\n","Processing asent: Paris, I said.\n","Processing asent: But thats a secret.\n","Processing asent: Dont tell anyone.\n","Processing asent: I have a job for you.\n","Processing asent: Do you think you could persuade those guards to call someone for you?\n","Processing asent: She nodded.\n","Processing asent: Im going to tell you a name, and I want you to go there, and find the person with that name, and only that person, and I want you to hand over this message.\n","Processing asent: She was either honest or realised, smart girl, that from where I stood I could see almost her entire route to the door of Bol Yean.\n","Processing asent: She delivered it.\n","Processing asent: She threaded in and out of the crowds, tiny and quickthe sooner this lucrative task was done the sooner she could get another.\n","Processing asent: It was easy to see why she and the other homeless children like her had the nickname job-mice.\n","Processing asent: A few minutes after she reached the gates, someone emerged, moving fast, bundled up, head down, walking stiffly and quickly away from the dig.\n","Processing asent: Though he was far away, alone like that and expected, I could tell that it was Aikam Tsueh.\n","Processing asent: I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE.\n","Processing asent: I could keep him in sight, but in a city I didnt know it was hard to do so while ensuring that I could not be seen.\n","Processing asent: He made it easier than it should have been, never once looking behind him, taking in all but a couple of places the largest, most crowded and crosshatched roads, which I presumed were the most direct routes.\n","Processing asent: The most complicated point came when he took a bus.\n","Processing asent: I was close to him, and was able to huddle behind my paper and keephim in sight.\n","Processing asent: I winced when my phone rang, but it was not the first in the bus to do so, and Aikam did not glance at me.\n","Processing asent: It was Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: I diverted the call and switched the ringer off.\n","Processing asent: Tsueh disembarked, and led me to a desolate total zone of Ul Qoman housing projects, out past Bisham Ko, way out from the centre.\n","Processing asent: No pretty corkscrew towers or iconic gasrooms here.\n","Processing asent: The concrete warrens were not deserted but full of noise and people between the stretches of garbage.\n","Processing asent: It was like the poorest estates of Besel, though even poorer, with a soundtrack in a different language, and children and hustlers in other clothes.\n","Processing asent: Only when Tsueh entered one of the dripping towerblocks and ascended did I have to exercise real care, padding as soundlessly as I could up the concrete stairs, past graffiti and animal shit.\n","Processing asent: I could hear him racing ahead of me, stopping at last, and knocking softly.\n","Processing asent: I slowed.\n","Processing asent: Its me, I heard him say.\n","Processing asent: Its me, Im here.\n","Processing asent: An answering voice, alarm, though that impression may have been because I expected alarm.\n","Processing asent: I continued to quietly and carefully climb.\n","Processing asent: I wished I had my gun.\n","Processing asent: Youtold me to, Tsueh said.\n","Processing asent: Yousaid .\n","Processing asent: Let me in.\n","Processing asent: What is it?\n","Processing asent: The door creaked a little, and the second voice came whispering, but just a little louder.\n","Processing asent: I was one stained pillar away now.\n","Processing asent: I held my breath.\n","Processing asent: But yousaid The door opened more and I heard Aikam step forward, and I turned and went fast across the little landing behind him.\n","Processing asent: He did not have time to register me, or to turn.\n","Processing asent: I shoved him hard, and he barrelled into the ajar door, slamming it open, pushing aside someone beyond him, falling and sprawling on the floor of the hallway beyond.\n","Processing asent: I heard a scream, but I had followed him through the door and slammed it closed behind me. I stood against it, blocking exit, looking along a gloomy corridor between rooms, down at where Tsueh wheezed and struggled to stand, at the screaming young woman backing away, staring at me in terror.\n","Processing asent: I put my finger to my lips and, surely by coincidence of her breath running out, she ebbed to silence.\n","Processing asent: No, Aikam, I said.\n","Processing asent: She didnt say.\n","Processing asent: The message wasnt from her.\n","Processing asent: Aikam, she blubbered.\n","Processing asent: Stop, I said.\n","Processing asent: I put my finger to my lips again.\n","Processing asent: Im not going to hurt you, Imnot here to hurt you, but we both know there are others who want to.\n","Processing asent: I want to help you, Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: She cried again and I could not tell if it was fear or relief.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Nineteen\n","Processing asent: AIKAM GOT TO HIS FEETand tried to attack me.\n","Processing asent: He was muscular and held his hands as if he had studied boxing but if he had he was not a good student.\n","Processing asent: I tripped him and pushed his face down onto the stained carpet, pinioned an arm behind his back.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda shouted his name.\n","Processing asent: He half rose, even with me straddling him, so I pushed his face down again, ensuring that his nose bled.\n","Processing asent: I stayed between both of them and the door.\n","Processing asent: Thats enough, I said.\n","Processing asent: Are you ready to calm down?\n","Processing asent: Im not here to hurt her.\n","Processing asent: Strength to strength, eventually he would overpower me unless I broke his arm.\n","Processing asent: Neither eventuality was desirable.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda, for Gods sake.\n","Processing asent: I caught her eye, riding his shuffles.\n","Processing asent: I have a gundont you think Id have shot you if I wanted to hurt you?\n","Processing asent: I switched to English for the lie.\n","Processing asent: Kam, she said at last, and almost instantly he grew calm.\n","Processing asent: She stared at me, backed into the wall at the corridors end, her hands flat against it.\n","Processing asent: You hurt my arm, Aikam said beneath me.\n","Processing asent: Sorry to hear it.\n","Processing asent: If I let him up, is he going to behave?\n","Processing asent: That in English again to her.\n","Processing asent: Im here to help you.\n","Processing asent: I know youre scared.\n","Processing asent: You hear me, Aikam?\n","Processing asent: Switching between two foreign languages was not hard, so adrenalised.\n","Processing asent: If I let you up, you going to go look after Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: He did nothing to clear away the blood that dripped from his nose.\n","Processing asent: He cradled his arm and, unable to put it comfortably around Yolanda, sort of loomed lovingly over and around her.\n","Processing asent: He put himself between me and her.\n","Processing asent: She looked out at me from behind him with wariness, not terror.\n","Processing asent: What do you want?\n","Processing asent: she said.\n","Processing asent: I know youre scared.\n","Processing asent: Im not Ul Qomamilitsya I dont trust them any more than you do.\n","Processing asent: Im not going to call them.\n","Processing asent: Let me help you.\n","Processing asent: IN WHAT YOLANDA RODRIGUEZcalled the living room she cowered in an old chair they had probably pulled in from an abandoned flat in the same tower.\n","Processing asent: There were several such pieces, broken in various ways but clean.\n","Processing asent: The windows overlooked the courtyard, from which I could hear Ul Qoman boys playing a rough makeshift version of rugby.\n","Processing asent: They were invisible through the whitewash on the glass.\n","Processing asent: Books and other things sat in boxes around the room.\n","Processing asent: A cheap laptop, a cheap inkjet printer.\n","Processing asent: No power, though, so far as I could tell.\n","Processing asent: There were no posters on the walls.\n","Processing asent: The door to the room was open.\n","Processing asent: I stood leaning by it, looking at the two pictures on the floor: one of Aikam; the other, in a better frame, of Yolanda and Mahalia smiling behind cocktails.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda stood, sat again.\n","Processing asent: She would not meet my eye.\n","Processing asent: She did not try to hide her fear, which had not abated though I was no longer its immediate object.\n","Processing asent: She was afraid to show or indulge her growing hope.\n","Processing asent: I had seen her expression before.\n","Processing asent: It is not uncommon for people to crave deliverance.\n","Processing asent: Aikams been doing a good job, I said.\n","Processing asent: I was back to English.\n","Processing asent: Though he did not speak it, Aikam did not ask for translation.\n","Processing asent: He stood by Yolandas chair and watched me.\n","Processing asent: You had him trying to find out how to get out of Ul Qoma, below the radar.\n","Processing asent: Any luck?\n","Processing asent: How did you know I was here?\n","Processing asent: Your boys been doing just what you told him to.\n","Processing asent: Hes been trying to find out whats going on.\n","Processing asent: What did he ever care about MahaliaGeary?\n","Processing asent: They never spoke.\n","Processing asent: Now you, though, he cares about.\n","Processing asent: So theres something odd when, like you told him to, hes been asking all about her.\n","Processing asent: Gets you thinking.\n","Processing asent: Why would he do that?\n","Processing asent: You, you did care about her, and you do care about yourself.\n","Processing asent: She stood again and turned her face to the wall.\n","Processing asent: I waited for her to say something, and when she did not I continued.\n","Processing asent: Im flattered youd get him to ask me.\n","Processing asent: The one police you think just might possibly not be part of whats happening.\n","Processing asent: The outsider.\n","Processing asent: You dont know!\n","Processing asent: She turned to me.\n","Processing asent: Idont trust you\n","Processing asent: Okay, okay, I never said you did.\n","Processing asent: A strange reassurance.\n","Processing asent: Aikam watched us jabbering.\n","Processing asent: So do you never leave?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: What do you eat?\n","Processing asent: Tins?\n","Processing asent: I guess Aikam comes, but not often\n","Processing asent: Cant come often.\n","Processing asent: How did you evenfind me?\n","Processing asent: He can explain.\n","Processing asent: He got a message to come back.\n","Processing asent: For what its worth he was trying to look after you.\n","Processing asent: He does that.\n","Processing asent: I can see.\n","Processing asent: Dogs began to fight outside, noise told us.\n","Processing asent: Their owners joined in.\n","Processing asent: My phone buzzed, audible even with the ringer off.\n","Processing asent: She started and backed away as if I might shoot her with it.\n","Processing asent: The display told me it was Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Look, I said.\n","Processing asent: Im turning it off.\n","Processing asent: Im turning it off.\n","Processing asent: If he was paying attention, he would know his call was rerouted to voicemail before the rings had all sounded out.\n","Processing asent: What happened?\n","Processing asent: Who got to you?\n","Processing asent: Why did you run when you did?\n","Processing asent: I didnt give them the chance.\n","Processing asent: You saw what happened to Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: She was myfriend .\n","Processing asent: I tried to tell myself it wasnt going down like that, but shesdead.\n","Processing asent: She said it with what sounded almost like awe.\n","Processing asent: Her face collapsed and she shook her head.\n","Processing asent: Theykilled her.\n","Processing asent: Your parents havent heard from you\n","Processing asent: I cant.\n","Processing asent: I cant, I have to She bit her nails and glanced up.\n","Processing asent: When I get out\n","Processing asent: Straight to the embassy next country along?\n","Processing asent: Through the mountains?\n","Processing asent: Why not here?\n","Processing asent: Or in Besel?\n","Processing asent: You know why.\n","Processing asent: Say I dont.\n","Processing asent: Becausetheyre here, and theyre there too.\n","Processing asent: Theyrun things.Looking for me.\n","Processing asent: Its just cause I got away when I did that they havent found me.\n","Processing asent: Theyre ready to kill me like they killed myfriend .\n","Processing asent: Because I know theyre there.\n","Processing asent: Because I know theyre real.\n","Processing asent: Her tone alone was enough reason for Aikam to hug her then.\n","Processing asent: Who?\n","Processing asent: Lets hear it.\n","Processing asent: The third place.\n","Processing asent: Between the city and the city.\n","Processing asent: Orciny.\n","Processing asent: A WEEK OR SOwould have been long enough ago for me to tell her she was being foolish or paranoid.\n","Processing asent: The hesitationwhen she told me about the conspiracy, there were those seconds when I was tacitly invited to tell her she was wrong, during which I was silent-vindicated her beliefs, gave her to think I agreed.\n","Processing asent: She stared and thought me a co-conspirator, and not knowing what was occurring I behaved like one.\n","Processing asent: I could not tell her her life was not in danger.\n","Processing asent: Nor that Bowdens was notperhaps he was dead alreadynor mine, nor that I could keep her safe.\n","Processing asent: I could tell her almost nothing.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda had stayed hidden in this place, that her loyal Aikam had found and tried to prepare, in this part of town that she had never intended to so much as visit and of which she did not know the name the day before she arrived here, after an arduous, circuitous and secret midnight dash.\n","Processing asent: He and she had done what they could to make the place bearable, but it was an abandoned hovel in a slum, that she could not quit for terror of being spotted by the unseen forces she knew wanted her dead.\n","Processing asent: I would say that she could never have seen the like of this place before, but that may not be true.\n","Processing asent: Maybe she had once or twice watched a documentary named something likeThe Dark Side of the Ul Qoma Dream orThe Sickness of the New Wolf or what have you.\n","Processing asent: Films about our neighbour were not generally popular in Besel, were rarely distributed, so I could not vouch, but it would not be surprising if some blockbuster had been made with the backdrop of gangs in the Ul Qoma slumsthe redemption of some not-too-hardcore drug-runner, the impressive murder of several others.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps Yolanda had seen footage of the failed estates of Ul Qoma, but she would not have meant to visit.\n","Processing asent: Do you know your neighbours?\n","Processing asent: She did not smile.\n","Processing asent: By voice.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda I know youre afraid.\n","Processing asent: They got Mahalia, they got Doctor Bowden, now theyre going to get me.\n","Processing asent: I know youre afraid, but you have to help me. I am going to get you out of here, but I need to know what happened.\n","Processing asent: If I dont know, I cant help you.\n","Processing asent: Help me?\n","Processing asent: She looked around the room.\n","Processing asent: You want me to tell you whats up?\n","Processing asent: Sure, you ready to bunk down here?\n","Processing asent: Youll have to, you know.\n","Processing asent: If you know whats going on, theyll come for you too.\n","Processing asent: She sighed and looked down.\n","Processing asent: Aikam said to her, Is it okay?\n","Processing asent: in Illitan, and she shrugged,Maybe .\n","Processing asent: HOW DID SHE FIND ORCINY?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: Where is it?\n","Processing asent: I dont know and I do not want to.\n","Processing asent: There are access points, she said.\n","Processing asent: She didnt tell me any more and that was alright by me.\n","Processing asent: Why didnt she tell anyone but you?\n","Processing asent: She seemed to know nothing of Jaris.\n","Processing asent: She wasnt crazy.\n","Processing asent: Youve seen what happened to Doctor Bowden?\n","Processing asent: You dont admit you want to know about Orciny.\n","Processing asent: That was always what she was here for, but she wouldnt tell anyone.\n","Processing asent: Thats how they want it.\n","Processing asent: Orcinians.\n","Processing asent: Its perfect for them that no one thinks theyre real.\n","Processing asent: Thats just what they want.\n","Processing asent: Thats how they rule.\n","Processing asent: She didnt care about it.\n","Processing asent: She was just doing enough to keep Prof Nance off her back.\n","Processing asent: She was here for Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Do you realise they contactedher.\n","Processing asent: She stared at me intently.\n","Processing asent: Seriously.\n","Processing asent: She was a bit the first time she was at a conference, in Besel, she sort of said a load of stuff.\n","Processing asent: There was a load of politicians and stuff there as well as academics and it caused a bit of\n","Processing asent: She made enemies.\n","Processing asent: I heard about it.\n","Processing asent: Oh, we all knew thenats had their eyes on her, nats on bothsides, but that wasnt the issue.\n","Processing asent: It wasOrciny who saw her then.\n","Processing asent: Theyre everywhere.\n","Processing asent: Certainly she had made herself visible.\n","Processing asent: Shura Katrinya had seen her: I remembered her face at the Oversight Committee when I mentioned the incident.\n","Processing asent: As had Mikhel Buric, I recalled, and a couple of others.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps Syedr had seen her too.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps there had been interested unknown others.\n","Processing asent: After she first started writing about them, after she was reading all that stuff inBetween , and writing it up, and researching, making all her mad little notesshe made tiny scribbling motionsshe got a letter.\n","Processing asent: Did she show you?\n","Processing asent: She nodded.\n","Processing asent: I didnt understand it when I saw it.\n","Processing asent: It was in the root form.\n","Processing asent: Precursor stuff, old script, before Bes and Illitan.\n","Processing asent: What did it say?\n","Processing asent: She told me.\n","Processing asent: It was something like:We are watching you.\n","Processing asent: You understand.\n","Processing asent: Would you like to know more?\n","Processing asent: There were others too.\n","Processing asent: She showed you?\n","Processing asent: Not straightaway.\n","Processing asent: What were they saying to her?\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: Because she worked them out.\n","Processing asent: They could tell she wanted to be part of it.\n","Processing asent: So theyrecruited her.\n","Processing asent: Had her do stuff for them, like, like initiation.\n","Processing asent: Give them information, deliver things.\n","Processing asent: This was impossible stuff.\n","Processing asent: With a look she challenged me to mock and I was silent.\n","Processing asent: They gave her addresses where she should leave letters and things.\n","Processing asent: Indissensi .\n","Processing asent: Messages back and forth.\n","Processing asent: She was writing back.\n","Processing asent: They were telling her things.\n","Processing asent: About Orciny.\n","Processing asent: She told me a little bit about it, and the history and that, and it was like Places no one can see because they think theyre in the other city.\n","Processing asent: Bes think its here; Ul Qomans think its in Besel.\n","Processing asent: The people in Orciny, theyre not like us.\n","Processing asent: They can do things that arent\n","Processing asent: Did she meet them?\n","Processing asent: Yolanda stood beside the window pane, staring out and down at an angle that kept her from being framed by its whitewash-diffused light.\n","Processing asent: She turned to look at me and said nothing.\n","Processing asent: She had calmed into despondency.\n","Processing asent: Aikam came closer to her.\n","Processing asent: His eyes went between us like a spectator at a tennis match.\n","Processing asent: Finally Yolanda shrugged.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: She wanted to.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: I know at first they said no.Not yet , they had said.\n","Processing asent: They told her stuff, history, stuff about what we were doing.\n","Processing asent: This stuff, the Precursor Age stuff itstheirs .\n","Processing asent: When Ul Qoma digs it up, or even Besel, theres this whole thing about whose is it, where was it found, you know, all that?\n","Processing asent: Its not Ul Qomas or Besels.\n","Processing asent: Its Orcinys; it always was.\n","Processing asent: They told her about stuff wed found thatno one who hadnt put it there could know .\n","Processing asent: This is their history.\n","Processing asent: They were here before Ul Qoma and Besel split, or joined, around them.\n","Processing asent: They never went away.\n","Processing asent: But it was just lying there until a bunch of Canadian archaeologists\n","Processing asent: Thats where theykept it.\n","Processing asent: That stuff wasnt lost.\n","Processing asent: The earth under Ul Qoma and Besels theirstore room.\n","Processing asent: Its all Orcinys.\n","Processing asent: It was all theirs, and we were just I think she was telling them where we were digging, what we were finding.\n","Processing asent: She was stealing for them.\n","Processing asent: We were stealingfrom them She never breached, you know.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: I thought all of you\n","Processing asent: You mean like games?\n","Processing asent: Not Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: She couldnt.\n","Processing asent: Too much to lose.\n","Processing asent: Too likely someone was watching, she said.\n","Processing asent: Shenever breached, not even in one of those ways that you cant tell, standing there, you know?\n","Processing asent: She wouldnt give Breach a chance to take her.\n","Processing asent: She shivered again.\n","Processing asent: I squatted down and looked around.\n","Processing asent: Aikam, she said in Illitan.\n","Processing asent: Can you get us something to drink?\n","Processing asent: He did not want to leave the room, but he could see she was not afraid of me anymore.\n","Processing asent: What she did do, she said, was go to these places where theyd leave her letters.\n","Processing asent: Thedissensi are entrances to Orciny.\n","Processing asent: She was so close to being part of it.\n","Processing asent: She thought.\n","Processing asent: At first.\n","Processing asent: I waited, and at last she continued.\n","Processing asent: I kept asking her what was up.\n","Processing asent: Something was really wrong, in the last couple of weeks.\n","Processing asent: She stopped going to the dig, meetings, everything.\n","Processing asent: What is it?\n","Processing asent: I kept saying, and at first she was like, Nothing, butin the end she told me she was scared.\n","Processing asent: Somethings wrong, she said.\n","Processing asent: Shed been frustrated I think because Orciny wouldnt let her in, and shed been going mad with work.\n","Processing asent: She was studying harder than Id ever seen.\n","Processing asent: I asked her what it was.\n","Processing asent: She just kept saying she was scared.\n","Processing asent: She said shed been going over and over her notes, and that she was figuring stuff out.\n","Processing asent: Bad stuff.\n","Processing asent: She said we could be thieves without even knowing.\n","Processing asent: Aikam came back.\n","Processing asent: He carried for me and for Yolanda warm cans of Qora-Oranja.\n","Processing asent: I think shed done something to make Orcinyangry .\n","Processing asent: She knew she was in trouble, and Bowden too.\n","Processing asent: She said so just before she\n","Processing asent: Why would they kill him?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: He doesnt even believe in Orciny any more.\n","Processing asent: Oh, God, of course he knows theyre real.\n","Processing asent: Of course he does.\n","Processing asent: Hes denied it for years because he needs work, but have you read his book?\n","Processing asent: Theyre going after everyone who knows about them.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia told me he was in trouble.\n","Processing asent: Just before she disappeared.\n","Processing asent: He knew too much, and I do too.\n","Processing asent: And now you do too.\n","Processing asent: What are you intending to do?\n","Processing asent: Stay here.\n","Processing asent: Hide.\n","Processing asent: Get out.\n","Processing asent: Hows that going?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: She looked at me in misery.\n","Processing asent: Your boy did his best.\n","Processing asent: He was asking me how a criminal might get out of the city.\n","Processing asent: She even smiled.\n","Processing asent: Let me help you.\n","Processing asent: You cant.\n","Processing asent: Theyre everywhere.\n","Processing asent: You dont know that.\n","Processing asent: How can you keep me safe?\n","Processing asent: Theyre going to get you now too.\n","Processing asent: Every few seconds there came the sounds of someone ascending outside the apartment, shouts and the noise of a handheld MP3 player, rap or Ul Qoman techno played loud enough to be insolent.\n","Processing asent: Such everyday noises could be camouflage.\n","Processing asent: Corwi was a city away.\n","Processing asent: Listening now it seemed that every few noises paused by the door to the apartment.\n","Processing asent: We dont know what the truth is, I said.\n","Processing asent: I had intended to say more, but realising that I was not sure whom I was trying to convince of what, I hesitated, and she interrupted me.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia did.\n","Processing asent: What are you doing?\n","Processing asent: I had taken out my phone.\n","Processing asent: I held it up as if surrendering, both hands.\n","Processing asent: Dont panic, I said.\n","Processing asent: I was just thinking we need to work out what were going to do.\n","Processing asent: There are people who might be able to help us\n","Processing asent: Stop, she said.\n","Processing asent: Aikam looked as if he might come for me again.\n","Processing asent: I got ready to sidestep but waved the phone so she could see it was not on.\n","Processing asent: Theres an option you never pursued, I said.\n","Processing asent: You could go outside, cross the road a little bit down the way there, and walk into YahudStrsz.\n","Processing asent: Its in Besel.\n","Processing asent: She looked at me as though I was crazy.\n","Processing asent: Stand there, wave your hands.\n","Processing asent: You could breach.\n","Processing asent: Her eyes got wider.\n","Processing asent: Another loud man ran upstairs outside, and we three waited.\n","Processing asent: Did you ever think it was worth a try?\n","Processing asent: Who can touchBreach?\n","Processing asent: If Orcinys out to get you Yolanda was staring at the boxes of her books, her boxed-up self.\n","Processing asent: Maybe youd be safer, even.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia said they were enemies, she said.\n","Processing asent: She sounded far away.\n","Processing asent: She once said the whole history of Besel and Ul Qoma was the history of the war between Orciny and Breach.\n","Processing asent: Besel and Ul Qoma were set up like chess moves, in that war.\n","Processing asent: They might do anything to me.\n","Processing asent: Come on, I interrupted.\n","Processing asent: You know most foreigners who breach are just ejected But she interrupted back.\n","Processing asent: Even if I knew what theyd do, which neither of us do, think about it.\n","Processing asent: A secret for like more than a thousand years, in between Ul Qoma and Besel, watching us all the time, whether we know it or not.\n","Processing asent: With its own agenda.\n","Processing asent: You think Id be safer if Breach had me?\n","Processing asent: In theBreach?\n","Processing asent: Im not Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: Im not sure Orciny and the Breach are enemies at all.\n","Processing asent: She looked at me then and I did not disdain her.\n","Processing asent: Maybe they work together.\n","Processing asent: Or maybe when youinvoke youve been handing power to Orciny for centuries, while you all sit there telling each other its a fairy tale.\n","Processing asent: I think Orciny is the name Breach calls itself.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty\n","Processing asent: FIRST SHE HAD NOT WANTED ME TO ENTER; then Yolanda did not want me to leave.\n","Processing asent: Theyll see you!\n","Processing asent: Theyll find you.\n","Processing asent: Theyll take you and then theyll come forme.\n","Processing asent: I cant stay here.\n","Processing asent: Theyll get you.\n","Processing asent: I cant stay here.\n","Processing asent: She watched me walk the width of the room, to the window and back to the door.\n","Processing asent: Dontyou cant make a phone call from here\n","Processing asent: You have to stop panicking.\n","Processing asent: But I stopped myself, because I was not sure that she was wrong to do so.\n","Processing asent: Aikam, are there other ways out of this building?\n","Processing asent: Not the way we came in?\n","Processing asent: He looked intently and emptily a moment.\n","Processing asent: Some of the apartments downstairs are empty, and maybe you could go through them\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: It had begun to rain, fingertipping against the obscured windows.\n","Processing asent: Judging by the halfhearted darkening of the white windows, it was only just overcast.\n","Processing asent: Washed out of colour, perhaps.\n","Processing asent: Still it felt safer to escape than if it had been clear or coldly sunny, as it had that morning.\n","Processing asent: I paced the room.\n","Processing asent: Youre alone in Ul Qoma, Yolanda whispered.\n","Processing asent: What can you do?\n","Processing asent: I looked at her at last.\n","Processing asent: Do you trust me?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Too bad.\n","Processing asent: Youve no choice.\n","Processing asent: Im going to get you out.\n","Processing asent: Im not in my element here, but\n","Processing asent: What do you want to do?\n","Processing asent: Im going to get you out of here, back to home ground, back to where I can make things happen.\n","Processing asent: Im going to get you to Besel.\n","Processing asent: She protested.\n","Processing asent: She had never been to Besel.\n","Processing asent: Both cities were controlled by Orciny, both were overlooked by Breach.\n","Processing asent: I interrupted her.\n","Processing asent: What else are you going to do?\n","Processing asent: Besels my city.\n","Processing asent: I cant negotiate the system here.\n","Processing asent: I have no contacts.\n","Processing asent: I dont know my way around.\n","Processing asent: But I can get you out from Besel, and you can help me.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda, shut up.\n","Processing asent: Aikam, dont move another step.\n","Processing asent: No time for this immobility.\n","Processing asent: She was right, I could promise her nothing but an attempt.\n","Processing asent: I can get you out, but not from here.\n","Processing asent: One more day.\n","Processing asent: Wait here.\n","Processing asent: Aikam, your jobs finished.\n","Processing asent: You dont work at Bol Yean any more.\n","Processing asent: Your jobs to stay here and look after Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: He would provide little protection, but his continued interventions at Bol Yean would eventually attract other peoples attention than my own.\n","Processing asent: I will be back.\n","Processing asent: You understand?\n","Processing asent: And Ill get you out.\n","Processing asent: She had food for some days, a diet of tins.\n","Processing asent: This little living room/bedroom, another, smaller, filled with only damp, the kitchen with its electricity and gas supplies disconnected.\n","Processing asent: The bathroom was not good but it would not kill them another day or two: from some standpipe Aikam had brought buckets that stood ready to flush.\n","Processing asent: The many air fresheners he had bought made a stink different than it would otherwise have been.\n","Processing asent: Stay, I said.\n","Processing asent: Ill be back.\n","Processing asent: Aikam recognised the phrase, though it was in English.\n","Processing asent: He smiled and so I said the words again for him in an Austrian accent.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda did not get it.\n","Processing asent: I will get you out, I said to her.\n","Processing asent: On the ground floor a few shoves at doors yielded me an empty apartment, a long time since fire-damaged but still smelling of carbon.\n","Processing asent: I stood in its glassless kitchen and watched the hardiest girls and boys outside refuse to get out of the rain.\n","Processing asent: I watched for a longtime, looking into all the shadows I could see.\n","Processing asent: I saw only those children.\n","Processing asent: My sleeves pulled over my fingertips in case of a fringe of glass, I vaulted out into the yard, where if any of the kids saw me emerge they did not remark.\n","Processing asent: I know how to watch to ensure I am not followed.\n","Processing asent: I walked quickly through the byway meanders of the project, between its bins and cars, graffiti and childrens playgrounds, until I made it out of cul-de-sac land into the streetscape of Ul Qoma, and Besel.\n","Processing asent: With relief at being one of several pedestrians rather than the only purposeful figure in sight, I breathed out a little, I took on the same rain-avoidance gait as everyone else, and at last turned on my phone.\n","Processing asent: It scolded me with how many messages I had missed.\n","Processing asent: All from Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: I was starving and uncertain of how to get back to the Old Town.\n","Processing asent: I wandered, looking for a Metro but finding a phone box.\n","Processing asent: I called him.\n","Processing asent: Where thefuck are you?\n","Processing asent: Whereve you been?\n","Processing asent: He was angry but conspiratorial, his voice quieter as he turned and muttered into his phone, not louder.\n","Processing asent: A good sign.\n","Processing asent: Ive been trying to call you for fucking hours.\n","Processing asent: Is everything Are you alright?\n","Processing asent: What the fucks going on?\n","Processing asent: Im alright, but\n","Processing asent: Something happened?\n","Processing asent: Anger but not only anger in his voice.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, something happened.\n","Processing asent: I cant talk about it.\n","Processing asent: The fuck you cant.\n","Processing asent: Listen.Listen .\n","Processing asent: I need to talk to you but I dont have time for this.\n","Processing asent: You want to know whats been going on, meet me, I dont knowflipping through my street mapin Kaing Sh, in the square by the station, in two hours, and Dhatt, donot bring anyone else.\n","Processing asent: This is serious shit.\n","Processing asent: Theres more going on here than you know.\n","Processing asent: I dont know who to talk to.\n","Processing asent: Now are you going to help me?\n","Processing asent: I made him wait an hour.\n","Processing asent: I watched him from the corner as he must surely have known I would.\n","Processing asent: Kaing Sh Station is the citys major terminus, so the square outside it bustled with Ul Qomans in cafs, by street performers, buying DVDs and electronics fromstalls.\n","Processing asent: The topolganger square in Besel was not quite empty, so unseen Bes citizens were grosstopically there too.\n","Processing asent: I stayed in the shadows of one of the cigarette kiosks shaped in homage to an Ul Qoman temporary hut, once common on the wetlands where scavengers sifted through the crosshatched mud.\n","Processing asent: I saw Dhatt look for me, but I stayed out of sight while it grew dark and watched to see if he made any calls (he did not) or hand signals (he did not).\n","Processing asent: He only set his face more and more as he drank teas and glowered in the shadows.\n","Processing asent: At last I stepped into his line of sight and moved my hand in a little regular motion that caught his eye and beckoned him over.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck is going on?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: Ive had your boss on the phone.\n","Processing asent: And Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Who the fuck is she anyway?\n","Processing asent: Whats happening?\n","Processing asent: I dont blame you being angry, but youre keeping your voice low, so youre being careful and you want to know whats going on.\n","Processing asent: Youre right.\n","Processing asent: Somethings up.\n","Processing asent: I found Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: When I would not tell him where she was he was enraged enough to start threatening an international incident.\n","Processing asent: This is not your fucking city, he said, you come here and use our resources, you fucking hold up our investigations, and so on, but still he kept his voice low and walked with me, so I let his anger ebb out a bit and began to tell him how Yolanda was afraid.\n","Processing asent: We both know we cant reassure her, I said.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Neither of us knows the truth about what the hells going on.\n","Processing asent: About the unifs, the nats, the bomb, aboutOrciny .\n","Processing asent: Shit, Dhatt, for all we know He stared at me, so I said, Whatever this isI glanced around to indicate everything that was happeningit goes somewhere bad.\n","Processing asent: We were both silent a while.\n","Processing asent: So why the fuck are you talking to me?\n","Processing asent: Because I need someone.\n","Processing asent: But yeah, youre right, it might be a mistake.\n","Processing asent: Youre the only person who might understand the scale of what might be going on.\n","Processing asent: I want to get her out.\n","Processing asent: Listen to me: this isnot about Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I dont trust my own lot any more than you.\n","Processing asent: I want to get that girl out, away from Ul Qomaand Besel.\n","Processing asent: And I cant do it from here; this isnt my patch.\n","Processing asent: Shes watched here.\n","Processing asent: Maybe I could.\n","Processing asent: You volunteering?\n","Processing asent: He said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: I am.\n","Processing asent: I have contacts back home.\n","Processing asent: You dont cop for this long without being able to score tickets and false papers.\n","Processing asent: I can hide her; I can talk to her in Besel before I get her out, get some more sense of all this.\n","Processing asent: This isnt about giving up: the opposite.\n","Processing asent: If we get her out of harms way weve got a much better chance of not getting blindsided.\n","Processing asent: We can maybe work out whats going on.\n","Processing asent: You said Mahalia had already made enemies back in Besel.\n","Processing asent: I thought you wanted them for this.\n","Processing asent: The nats?\n","Processing asent: That doesnt make much sense anymore.\n","Processing asent: A, all this is way beyond Syedr and his boys, and B,Yolanda hasnt pissed offanyone back home; shes never been there.\n","Processing asent: I can do my job there.\n","Processing asent: I could go beyond my job, I meantcould pull strings and favours.\n","Processing asent: Im not trying to cut you out, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Ill tell you what I know if I get any more from her, maybe even come back and we can go hunting criminals, but I want to get that girl out of here.\n","Processing asent: Shes scared to death, Dhatt, and can we really say shes wrong to be?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt kept shaking his head.\n","Processing asent: He was neither agreeing nor disagreeing with me.\n","Processing asent: After a minute he spoke again, tersely.\n","Processing asent: I sent my crew back to the unifs.\n","Processing asent: No sign of Jaris.\n","Processing asent: We dont even know the little fuckers real name.\n","Processing asent: If any of his mates know where he is or that he was seeing her theyre not saying.\n","Processing asent: Do you believe them?\n","Processing asent: He shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Weve been checking them out.\n","Processing asent: Cant find anything.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt look like they know shit.\n","Processing asent: One or two of them its obvious Marya rings a bell, but most of them never even met her.\n","Processing asent: This is all beyond them.\n","Processing asent: Oh, theyre up to all kinds of shit, dont you worry; weve got moles say theyre going to do this and that, theyre going to break the boundaries, planning all sorts of revolutions\n","Processing asent: Thats not what were talking about.\n","Processing asent: And you hear that stuff all the time.\n","Processing asent: He was silent while I listed for him again what had happened on our watch.\n","Processing asent: We slowed down in the dark and sped up in the pools of lamplight.\n","Processing asent: When I told him that according to Yolanda, Mahalia hadsaid that Bowden was in danger too, he halted.\n","Processing asent: We stood in that freezing silence for seconds.\n","Processing asent: Today while you were fucking around with Little Miss Paranoid we searched Bowdens flat.\n","Processing asent: Theres no sign of forced entry, no sign of struggle.\n","Processing asent: Nothing.\n","Processing asent: Food left on the side, books page-down on the chair.\n","Processing asent: We did find a letter on his desk.\n","Processing asent: Yallya told me youd be onto something.\n","Processing asent: The letter doesnt say.\n","Processing asent: Its not in Illitan.\n","Processing asent: It was just a single word.\n","Processing asent: I thought it was in weird-looking Bes but it isnt.\n","Processing asent: Its in Precursor.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: What does it say?\n","Processing asent: I took it to Nancy.\n","Processing asent: She said its an old version of the script she hasnt seen before and she wouldnt want to swear to it yadda yadda, but shes pretty sure its a warning.\n","Processing asent: A warning of what?\n","Processing asent: Just a warning.\n","Processing asent: Like a skull-and-crossbones.\n","Processing asent: A word thatis a warning.\n","Processing asent: It was dark enough that we could not see each others faces well.\n","Processing asent: Not deliberately, I had steered us close to an intersection with a total Bes street.\n","Processing asent: Those squat brick buildings in their brown light, the men and women walking beneath them in long coats under the swinging sepia signs that I unsaw bisected the Ul Qoman sodium-lit strip of glass fronts and imports like something old and recurrent.\n","Processing asent: So who might use that kind of?\n","Processing asent: Dont fucking tell me about secret cities.\n","Processing asent: Dont.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt looked haunted and hunted.\n","Processing asent: He looked sick.\n","Processing asent: He turned and bundled himself into the corner of a doorway, punched his own palm furiously several times.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck?\n","Processing asent: he said, looking into the dark.\n","Processing asent: What lived like Orciny would live, if one indulged Yolandas and Mahalias ideas?\n","Processing asent: Something so small, so powerful, lodged in the crevices of another organism.\n","Processing asent: Willing to kill.\n","Processing asent: A parasite.\n","Processing asent: A tick-city, quite ruthless.\n","Processing asent: Even if even if, say, something is wrong with my lot and your lot, whatever, Dhatt said at last.\n","Processing asent: Controlled.\n","Processing asent: Bought.\n","Processing asent: Whatever.\n","Processing asent: Even if.\n","Processing asent: We whispered under the foreign shriek of a flap above us in Besel swinging in the wind.\n","Processing asent: Yolandas convinced that Breach is Orciny, I said.\n","Processing asent: Im not saying I agree with herI dont know what Im sayingbut I promised her Id get her out.\n","Processing asent: Breach would get her out.\n","Processing asent: You prepared to swear shes wrong?\n","Processing asent: You prepared to abso-bloody-lutely swear shes got nothing to worry about from them?\n","Processing asent: I was whispering.\n","Processing asent: This was dangerous talk.\n","Processing asent: Theyve no way in yetnothings fucking breachedand she wants to keep it that way.\n","Processing asent: So what do you want to do?\n","Processing asent: I want to get her away.\n","Processing asent: Im not saying anyone heres got her in their sights, Im not saying shes right about anything shes saying, butsomeone killed Mahalia, and someone got to Bowden.\n","Processing asent: Somethings going on in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Im asking for your help, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Come with me.\n","Processing asent: We cant do this officially; she wont cooperate with anything official.\n","Processing asent: I promised her Id look after her, and this is not my city.\n","Processing asent: You going to help me?\n","Processing asent: No, we cant risk doing this by the book.\n","Processing asent: So are you going to help me?\n","Processing asent: I need to get her to Besel.\n","Processing asent: We did not go back to the hotel room that night, nor to Dhatts house.\n","Processing asent: Not overcome by anxiety but indulging it, behavingas if this all might be true.\n","Processing asent: We walked instead.\n","Processing asent: Fucks sake, cant believe Im doing this, he kept saying.\n","Processing asent: He looked behind us more than I did.\n","Processing asent: We can find a way to blame me, I told him.\n","Processing asent: It was not what I might have expected, despite that Id risked telling him what I had, to have him be part of this, to put himself so on this line.\n","Processing asent: Stick us to crowds, I told him.\n","Processing asent: And to crosshatching.\n","Processing asent: More people, and where the two cities are close up they make for interference patterns, harder to read or predict.\n","Processing asent: They are more than a city and a city; that is elementary urban arithmetic.\n","Processing asent: Ive got an exit anytime on my visa, I said.\n","Processing asent: Can you get her a pass out?\n","Processing asent: I can get one for me, sure.\n","Processing asent: I can get one for a fuckingcop , Borl.\n","Processing asent: Let me rephrase that.\n","Processing asent: Can you get an exit visa for Officer Yolanda Rodriguez?\n","Processing asent: He stared at me.\n","Processing asent: We were still whispering.\n","Processing asent: She wont even have an Ul Qoman passport\n","Processing asent: Socan you get her through?\n","Processing asent: I dont know what your border guards are like.\n","Processing asent: Oh what the fuck?\n","Processing asent: he said again.\n","Processing asent: As the numbers of walkers fell our pedestrianism ceased being camouflage and risked becoming its opposite.\n","Processing asent: I know a place, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: A drinking club, the manager of which greeted him with almost convincing pleasure, in the basement opposite a bank in the outskirts of Ul Qoma Old Town.\n","Processing asent: It was full of smoke and men who eyed Dhatt, knowing what he was, despite that he was in civilian clothes.\n","Processing asent: It looked for a second as if they thought him there to bust the drag act, but he waved at them to get on with it.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt gestured for the managers phone.\n","Processing asent: Lips thinned, the man passed it to him over the counter and he passed it to me.\n","Processing asent: Holy Light, lets do this, then, he said.\n","Processing asent: I can get her through.\n","Processing asent: There was music, and the growl of conversation was very loud.\n","Processing asent: I stretched the phone to the extent of its cord and huddled down, squatting, by the bar, at stomach-level of the men around me.\n","Processing asent: It felt quieter.\n","Processing asent: I had to go through an operator to get an international line, which I did not like to do.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, its Borl.\n","Processing asent: Christ.\n","Processing asent: Give me a minute.\n","Processing asent: Christ.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, Im sorry to call so late.\n","Processing asent: Can you hear me?\n","Processing asent: Christ.\n","Processing asent: What time Where are you?\n","Processing asent: I cant fucking hear a word, youre all\n","Processing asent: Im in a bar.\n","Processing asent: Listen, Im sorry about the time.\n","Processing asent: I need you to organise something for me.\n","Processing asent: Christ, boss, are you fucking kidding?\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, I need you.\n","Processing asent: I could almost see her rubbing her face, maybe walking phone in hand and sleepy to the kitchen and drinking cold water.\n","Processing asent: When she spoke again she was more focused.\n","Processing asent: Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: Im coming back.\n","Processing asent: Serious?\n","Processing asent: When?\n","Processing asent: Thats what Im calling about.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, the guy Im working with here, hes coming over to Besel.\n","Processing asent: I need you to meet us.\n","Processing asent: Can you geteverything in motion and keep it on the QT?\n","Processing asent: Corwiblack-ops stuff.\n","Processing asent: Serious.\n","Processing asent: Walls have ears.\n","Processing asent: Long pause.\n","Processing asent: Why me, boss?\n","Processing asent: And why at two-thirty in the morning?\n","Processing asent: Because youre good, and because youre the soul of discretion.\n","Processing asent: I need no noise.\n","Processing asent: I need you in a car, with your gun and preferably one for me, and thats it.\n","Processing asent: And I need you to book a hotel for them.\n","Processing asent: Not one of

asent: Shesundercover .\n","Processing asent: What do you think?\n","Processing asent: She wanted a free trip.\n","Processing asent: I glanced apology at him, though he could not hear me over the criminal din.\n","Processing asent: Keep this low, Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Just a little moment in the investigation, okay?\n","Processing asent: And Im going to want your help getting something, getting a package, out of Besel.\n","Processing asent: You understand?\n","Processing asent: Think so, boss.\n","Processing asent: Boss, someones been calling for you.\n","Processing asent: Asking whats going on with your investigation.\n","Processing asent: Who?\n","Processing asent: What do you mean, whats going on?\n","Processing asent: Who I dont know, wont leave his name.\n","Processing asent: He wants to know, Who are you arresting?\n","Processing asent: When are you back?\n","Processing asent: Have you found the missing girl?\n","Processing asent: What are the plans?\n","Processing asent: I dont know how he got my desk number, but he blatantly knows something.\n","Processing asent: I was clicking at Dhatt to pay attention.\n","Processing asent: Someones asking questions, I said to him.\n","Processing asent: Wont say his name?\n","Processing asent: I asked Corwi.\n","Processing asent: No, and I dont recognise his voice.\n","Processing asent: Crap line.\n","Processing asent: What does he sound like?\n","Processing asent: Foreign.\n","Processing asent: American.\n","Processing asent: And scared.\n","Processing asent: On a bad, an international, line.\n","Processing asent: Goddamn, I said to Dhatt, hand over the receiver.\n","Processing asent: Bowdens out there.\n","Processing asent: Hes trying to find me.\n","Processing asent: He must be avoiding our numbers here in case hes traced Canadian, Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Listen, when did he call?\n","Processing asent: Every day, yesterday and today, wont leave his details.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: Listen.\n","Processing asent: When he calls again, tell him this.\n","Processing asent: Give him this message from me.\n","Processing asent: Tell him hes got one chance.\n","Processing asent: Hold on, Im thinking.\n","Processing asent: Tell him were Tell him Ill make sure hes okay, I can gethim out.\n","Processing asent: Wehave to.\n","Processing asent: I know hes afraid with everything going on, but hes got no chance on his own.\n","Processing asent: Keep this to yourself, Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, youre determined to fuck my career.\n","Processing asent: She sounded tired.\n","Processing asent: I waited silently until I was sure she would do it.\n","Processing asent: Thank you.\n","Processing asent: Just trust me hell understand and please dont ask me anything.\n","Processing asent: Tell him we know more now.\n","Processing asent: Shit, I cant go into this.\n","Processing asent: A loud burst from the sequined Ute Lemper look-alike made me wince.\n","Processing asent: Just tell him we know more and tell him he has to call us.\n","Processing asent: I looked around as if inspiration might jump to me, and it did.\n","Processing asent: Whats Yallyas mobile number?\n","Processing asent: I asked Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: He doesnt want to call us on mine or yours, so just He recited it to me and I to Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Tell our mystery man to callthat number, and we can help him.\n","Processing asent: And you call me back on that, too, okay?\n","Processing asent: From tomorrow on.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck?\n","Processing asent: said Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck are you doing?\n","Processing asent: Youre going to have to borrow her phone; we need one so Bowden can find ushes too scared to, we dont know whos listening to ours.\n","Processing asent: If he contacts us, you might have to I hesitated.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, Dhatt, notnow , okay?\n","Processing asent: Corwi?\n","Processing asent: She was gone, the line disconnected, by her or by the old exchanges.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-One\n","Processing asent: I EVEN CAME WITH DHATTinto his office the next day.\n","Processing asent: The more youre a no-show, the more people wonder what the fucks going on and the more theyre going to notice you, he said.\n","Processing asent: As it was there were plenty of stares from his office colleagues.\n","Processing asent: I nodded at the two who had tried halfheartedly to start an altercation with me.\n","Processing asent: Im getting paranoid, I said.\n","Processing asent: Oh no, theyre really watching you.\n","Processing asent: Here.\n","Processing asent: He handed me Yallyas cell phone.\n","Processing asent: I think thats the last time youre getting invited to supper.\n","Processing asent: What did she say?\n","Processing asent: What do you think?\n","Processing asent: Its her fucking phone; she was seriously pissed off.\n","Processing asent: I told her we needed it, she told me to fuck off, I begged, she said no, I took it and blamed you.\n","Processing asent: Can we get hold of a uniform?\n","Processing asent: For Yolanda We huddled over his computer.\n","Processing asent: Might get her through easier.\n","Processing asent: I watched him use his more up-to-date version of Windows.\n","Processing asent: The first time Yallyas phone rang we froze and looked at each other.\n","Processing asent: A number appeared that neither of us knew.\n","Processing asent: I connected without a word, still meeting his eyes.\n","Processing asent: Yall?\n","Processing asent: Yall?\n","Processing asent: A womans voice in Illitan.\n","Processing asent: Its Mai, are you Yall?\n","Processing asent: Hello, this isnt Yallya actually\n","Processing asent: Oh, hey, Qussim ?\n","Processing asent: but her voice faltered.\n","Processing asent: Who is this?\n","Processing asent: He took it from me.\n","Processing asent: Hello?\n","Processing asent: Mai, hey.\n","Processing asent: Yeah, hes a friend of mine.\n","Processing asent: No, well spotted.\n","Processing asent: I had to borrow Yalls phone for a day or two, have you tried the house?\n","Processing asent: Alright then, take care.\n","Processing asent: The screen went dark and he handed it back.\n","Processing asent: Thats another fucking reason you can field this shit.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to get a pissload of calls from her friends asking you if you still want to go for that facial or if youve seen the Tom Hanks movie.\n","Processing asent: After the second and third such call, we no longer started when the cell rang.\n","Processing asent: There were not many, however, despite what Dhatt said, and none on those topics.\n","Processing asent: I imagined Yallya on her office phone, making countless angry calls denouncing her husband and his friend for the inconvenience.\n","Processing asent: Do we want to put her in a uniform?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt spoke low.\n","Processing asent: Youre going to be in yours, right?\n","Processing asent: Isnt it always best to hide in plain sight?\n","Processing asent: You want one too?\n","Processing asent: Is it a bad idea?\n","Processing asent: He shook his head slowly.\n","Processing asent: Itll make life easier for some of it I think I can get through my side on police papers and my say-so.Militsya , let alone senior detectives, trumped Ul Qoman border guards, without much trouble.\n","Processing asent: Alright.\n","Processing asent: Ill do the talking at the Besel entrance.\n","Processing asent: Is Yolanda okay?\n","Processing asent: Aikams with her.\n","Processing asent: I cant go back Not again.\n","Processing asent: Every time we do We still had no idea how, or by whom, we might be watched.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt moved too much, and after the third or fourth time he had snapped at one of his colleagues for some imagined infraction I made him come with me for an early lunch.\n","Processing asent: He glowered and would not speak, staring at everyone who passed us.\n","Processing asent: Will you stop?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I am going to be so fucking glad when youre gone, he said.\n","Processing asent: Yallyas phone rang and I held it to my ear without speaking.\n","Processing asent: Borl?\n","Processing asent: I tapped the table for Dhatts attention, pointed at the phone.\n","Processing asent: Bowden, where are you?\n","Processing asent: Im keeping myself safe, Borl.\n","Processing asent: He spoke in Bes to me.\n","Processing asent: You dont sound like you feel safe.\n","Processing asent: Of course not.\n","Processing asent: Im not safe, am I?\n","Processing asent: The question is, how much trouble am I in?\n","Processing asent: His voice was very strained.\n","Processing asent: I can get you out.\n","Processing asent: Could I?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt shrugged an exaggeratedwhat the fuck?\n","Processing asent: There are ways out.\n","Processing asent: Tell me where you are.\n","Processing asent: He sort of laughed.\n","Processing asent: Right, he said.\n","Processing asent: Ill just tell you where I am.\n","Processing asent: What else do you propose?\n","Processing asent: You cant spend your life in hiding.\n","Processing asent: Get out of Ul Qoma and I can maybe do something.\n","Processing asent: Besels my turf.\n","Processing asent: You dont even know whats going on\n","Processing asent: Youve got one chance.\n","Processing asent: Help

Where are you?\n","Processing asent: Nowhere.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt matter.\n","Processing asent: Ill Where areyou?\n","Processing asent: I dont want to\n","Processing asent: Youve done well to stay out of sight this long.\n","Processing asent: But you cant do it forever.\n","Processing asent: Ill find you.\n","Processing asent: Are you crossing now?\n","Processing asent: I couldnt help glancing around and lowering my voice again.\n","Processing asent: Soon.\n","Processing asent: Soon.\n","Processing asent: Ill tell you when I know.\n","Processing asent: How do I contact you?\n","Processing asent: You dont, Borl.\n","Processing asent: Ill contact you.\n","Processing asent: Keep this phone.\n","Processing asent: What if you miss me?\n","Processing asent: Ill just have to call every couple of hours.\n","Processing asent: Im afraid Im going to have tobother you, a lot.\n","Processing asent: He disconnected.\n","Processing asent: I stared at Yallyas phone, looked up at last at Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Do you have any fucking idea how much I hate not knowingwhere I can look?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt whispered.\n","Processing asent: Who I can trust?\n","Processing asent: He shuffled papers.\n","Processing asent: What I should be saying to whom?\n","Processing asent: Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: Does he want out too?\n","Processing asent: He wants out too.\n","Processing asent: Hes afraid.\n","Processing asent: He doesnt trust us.\n","Processing asent: I dont blame him one bit.\n","Processing asent: Neither do I.\n","Processing asent: I dont have any papers for him.\n","Processing asent: I met his eye and waited.\n","Processing asent: HolyLight , Borl, you going to fucking He whispered furiously.\n","Processing asent: Alright, alright, Ill see what I can do.\n","Processing asent: Tellme what to do, I said to him, without breaking my gaze, who to call, what corners to cut, and you can fucking blame me.\n","Processing asent: Blame me, Dhatt.Please .\n","Processing asent: But bring a uniform in case he comes.\n","Processing asent: I watched him, poor man, agonise.\n","Processing asent: It was after 7 p.m. that night that Corwi called me.\n","Processing asent: Were go, she said.\n","Processing asent: Ive got the paperwork.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, I owe you, I owe you.\n","Processing asent: Do you think I dont know that, boss?\n","Processing asent: Its you, your guy Dhatt, and his ahem colleague, right?\n","Processing asent: Ill be waiting.\n","Processing asent: Bring your ID and be ready to back me up with Immigration.\n","Processing asent: Who else?\n","Processing asent: Who else knows?\n","Processing asent: No one.\n","Processing asent: Im your designated driver, again, then.\n","Processing asent: What time?\n","Processing asent: The question, what is the best way to disappear?\n","Processing asent: There must be a graph, a carefully plotted curve.\n","Processing asent: Is something more invisible if there are no others around, or if it is one of many?\n","Processing asent: Not too late.\n","Processing asent: Not like two in the morning.\n","Processing asent: Im glad to fucking hear it.\n","Processing asent: Wed be the only ones there.\n","Processing asent: But not in the middle of the day either; theres too much risk someone might know us or something.\n","Processing asent: After dark.\n","Processing asent: Eight, I said.\n","Processing asent: Tomorrow evening.\n","Processing asent: It was winter and the nights came early.\n","Processing asent: There would be crowds still, but in the dim colours of evening, sleepy.\n","Processing asent: Easy not to see.\n","Processing asent: IT WAS NOT ALL LEGERDEMAIN; there were tasks we should and did perform.\n","Processing asent: Reports of progress to finesse, and families to contact.\n","Processing asent: I watched and with occasional over-the-shoulder suggestions helpedDhatt construct a letter saying polite and regretful nothing to Mr. and Mrs. Geary, whose main liaison now was with the Ul Qomamilitsya .\n","Processing asent: It was not a good feeling of power, to be present a ghost in that holding message, knowing them, seeing them from inside the words which would be like one-way glass, so they could not look back in and see me, one of the writers.\n","Processing asent: I told Dhatt a placeI did not know the address, had to describe it in vague topography, which he recogniseda piece of parkland walking distance from where Yolanda hid, to meet me at the end of the following day.\n","Processing asent: Anyone asks, tell them Im working from the hotel.\n","Processing asent: Tell them about all the ridiculous paperwork hoops they make us jump through in Besel, that keep me busy.\n","Processing asent: Its all we ever fucking talk about, Tyad.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt could not stay in one place, he was so anxious, so frenetic with lack of trust, in anything, so troubled.\n","Processing asent: He did not know where to look.\n","Processing asent: Blame you or not, Im going to be on school liaison for the rest of my fucking career.\n","Processing asent: We had agreed there was a good possibility we would not hear from Bowden again, but I got a call on poor Yallyas phone half an hour after midnight.\n","Processing asent: I was sure it was Bowden though he said nothing.\n","Processing asent: He called again just before seven the next morning.\n","Processing asent: You sound bad, Doctor.\n","Processing asent: Whats happening?\n","Processing asent: What do you want to do?\n","Processing asent: Are you going?\n","Processing asent: Is Yolanda with you?\n","Processing asent: Is she coming?\n","Processing asent: You have one shot, Doctor.\n","Processing asent: I scribbled times on my notepad.\n","Processing asent: If youre not going to let me come for you.\n","Processing asent: You want out, be outside the main traffic gate of Copula Hall at seven p.m.\n","Processing asent: I disconnected.\n","Processing asent: I tried to make notes, plans on paper, could not.\n","Processing asent: Bowden did not call me back.\n","Processing asent: I kept the phone on the table or in my hand throughout my early breakfast.\n","Processing asent: I did not check out of the hotelno telegraphing of movements.\n","Processing asent: I sorted through my clothes for anything I could not afford to leave, and there was nothing.\n","Processing asent: I carried my illegal volumeof Between the City and the City , and that was all.\n","Processing asent: I took almost the whole day to get to Yolanda and Aikams hide.My last day in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I took taxis in stages to the ends of the city.\n","Processing asent: How long you staying?\n","Processing asent: the last driver asked me.\n","Processing asent: A couple of weeks.\n","Processing asent: You like it here, he said, in enthusiastic beginners Illitan.\n","Processing asent: Best city in the world.\n","Processing asent: He was Kurdish.\n","Processing asent: Show me your favourite parts of town, then.\n","Processing asent: You dont get trouble?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Not everyones welcoming to foreigners, I heard\n","Processing asent: He made a pooh-poohing noise.\n","Processing asent: Are fools all over everywhere, but is the best city.\n","Processing asent: How long have you been here?\n","Processing asent: Four years and some.\n","Processing asent: I was one year in camp\n","Processing asent: A refugee camp?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, in the camp, and three years study for Ul Qoma citizenship.\n","Processing asent: Speaking Illitan and learning, you know, not to, you know to unsee the other place, so not to breach.\n","Processing asent: Did you ever think of going to Besel?\n","Processing asent: Another snort.\n","Processing asent: Whats in Besel?\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma is the best place.\n","Processing asent: He took me first past the Orchidarium and the Xhincis Kann Stadium, a tourist route he had obviously taken before, and when I encouraged him to indulge more personal preferences he started to show me the community gardens where alongside Ul Qoman natives those Kurds, Pakistanis, Somalis and Sierra Leoneans who got through the stringent conditions for entry played chess, the various communities regarding each other with courteous uncertainty.\n","Processing asent: At a crossroads of canals he, careful not to say anything unequivocally illegal, pointed out to me where the barges of the two cities-pleasure craft in Ul Qoma, a few working transport boats unseen in Beselwove between each other.\n","Processing asent: You see?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: A man on the opposite side of a nearby lock, half-hidden in people and little urban trees, was looking straight at us.\n","Processing asent: I met his eyefor a moment I was not sure but then decided he must be in Ul Qoma, so it was not breachuntil he looked away.\n","Processing asent: I tried to watch where he went, but he was gone.\n","Processing asent: When I expressed choices between the various sights the driver proposed, I made sure the resulting route crisscrossed the city.\n","Processing asent: Iwatched the mirrors as he, delighted with this fare, drove.\n","Processing asent: If we were followed it was by very sophisticated and careful spies.\n","Processing asent: I paid him a ridiculous amount, in a much harder currency than I was paid in, after three hours of escorting, and I had him drop me where backstreet hackers abutted cheap secondhand shops, around the corner from the estate where Yolanda and Aikam hid.\n","Processing asent: For moments I thought they had skipped out on me, and I closed my eyes, but I kept repeating in a whisper up close to the door, Its me, its Borl, its me, and at last it opened, and Aikam ushered me in.\n","Processing asent: Get ready, I said to Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: She looked dirty to me, thinner and more startled like an animal than even when I had last seen her.\n","Processing asent: Get your papers.\n","Processing asent: Be ready to agree with whatever me or my colleagues say to anyone at the border.\n","Processing asent: And get lover-boy used to the idea that hes not coming, because were not having a scene at Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: Were getting you out.\n","Processing asent: SHE MADE HIM STAY IN THE ROOM.\n","Processing asent: He looked as if he would not do as she asked, but she made him.\n","Processing asent: I did not trust him to be unobtrusive.\n","Processing asent: He demanded to know again and again why he could not come.\n","Processing asent: She showed him where she had his number, and she swore that she would call him from Besel, and from Canada, and that she would call for him there.\n","Processing asent: It took her several such promises until he stood at last miserable as a neglected thing, staring as we closed the door on him and walked fast through the shadowing light to the corner of the park, where Dhatt was waiting in an unmarked police car.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: He nodded to her from the drivers seat.\n","Processing asent: Pain in my arse.\n","Processing asent: He nodded to me.\n","Processing asent: We set off.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck?\n","Processing asent: Who exactlyhave you pissed off, Miss Rodriguez?\n","Processing asent: Youve got me fucking my life and collaborating with this foreign wacko.\n","Processing asent: Theres clothes in the back, he said.\n","Processing asent: Course Im out of work, now.\n","Processing asent: He very well might not be exaggerating.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda stared at him until he glanced into the mirror andsnapped at her, For fucks sake, what, you think Impeeping ?\n","Processing asent: and she scootched down in the rear seat and began to wriggle out of her clothes, replacing them with themilitsya uniform he had brought for her, that almost fit.\n","Processing asent: Miss Rodriguez, do as I say and stick close.\n","Processing asent: Theres fancy dress for our possible-other-guest too.\n","Processing asent: And thats for you, Borl.\n","Processing asent: Might save us a bit of shit.\n","Processing asent: A jacket with a fold-downmilitsya blazon on it.\n","Processing asent: I made it visible.\n","Processing asent: I wish they had rank on them.\n","Processing asent: Idve fucking demoted you.\n","Processing asent: He did not meander, nor make the mistake of the guilty nervous and drive more slowly, more carefully than the cars around us.\n","Processing asent: We took the main streets, and he flicked on and off the headlights at other drivers infractions as Ul Qoman drivers do, little messages of road-rage code like aggressive Morse,flick flick, you cut me up, flick flick flick, make up your mind .\n","Processing asent: He called again, I said to Dhatt quietly.\n","Processing asent: He might be there.\n","Processing asent: In which case\n","Processing asent: Come on, pain in my arse, say it again.\n","Processing asent: In which case hes going over, right?\n","Processing asent: Hes got to get out.\n","Processing asent: Did you get spare papers?\n","Processing asent: He swore and punched the steering wheel.\n","Processing asent: Fuck I really wish Id thought of a way to talk myself out of this fucking shit.\n","Processing asent: I hope he doesnt come.\n","Processing asent: I hope fucking Orcinydoes get him.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda stared at him.\n","Processing asent: Ill sound out whoevers on duty.\n","Processing asent: Get ready to crack out your wallet.\n","Processing asent: If push comes to shove Ill give him my fucking papers.\n","Processing asent: We saw Copula Hall over the roofs and through cables of telephone exchanges and gasrooms many minutes before we arrived at it.\n","Processing asent: The way we came, we first passed, as unseeing as we could, the buildings rear-to-Ul Qoma, its entryway in Besel, the queues of Bes and returning Ul Qoman passengers siphoning in in patient dudgeon.\n","Processing asent: A Bes police light was flashing.\n","Processing asent: We were obliged not to and did not see any of it, but we could not but be aware as we did so that we would be on that side soon.\n","Processing asent: We rounded the huge building to its Ul Maidin Avenue entrance, opposite the Temple of Inevitable Light, where the slow line into Besel proceeded.\n","Processing asent: There Dhattparkeda bad job not corrected, skewed from the kerb with the swagger ofmilitsya , keys hanging readyand we emerged to cross through the night crowds towards the great forecourt and the borders of Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: The outer guards ofmilitsya did not ask a thing or even speak to us as we cut across the lines of people, walked over the roads weaving through stationary traffic, only ushered us through the restricted gates and on into the grounds proper of Copula Hall, where the huge edifice waited to eat us.\n","Processing asent: I looked everywhere as we came.\n","Processing asent: Our eyes never stopped moving.\n","Processing asent: I walked behind Yolanda, moving uneasily in her disguise.\n","Processing asent: I raised my stare above the sellers of food and tat, the guards, the tourists, the homeless men and women, the othermilitsya .\n","Processing asent: Of the many entrances we had chosen the most open, wide and unconvoluted under a vault of old brickwork, with a view clear through the yawning interstitial space, over the mass of crowds filling the great chamber on both sides of the checkpointthough more, noticeably, on the Besel side, wanting to come in to Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: From this position, this vantage angle, for the first time in a long time we did not have to unsee the neighbouring city: we could stare along the road that linked Ul Qoma to it, over the border, the metres of no-mans-land and the border beyond, directly into Besel itself.\n","Processing asent: Straight ahead.\n","Processing asent: Blue lights awaited us.\n","Processing asent: A Bes bruise just visible beyond the lowered gate between the states, the flashing we had unseen minutes before.\n","Processing asent: As we passed the outer fringes of Copula Halls architecture, I saw at the far end of the hall standing on the raised platform where the Bes guards watched the crowds a figure inpoliczai uniform.\n","Processing asent: A womanshe was very distant yet, on the Besel side of the gates.\n","Processing asent: Corwi.\n","Processing asent: I did not know Id said her name aloud until Dhatt said to me, That her?\n","Processing asent: I was about to tell him it was too far off to know, but he said to me, Hold on a second.\n","Processing asent: He was looking back the way we had come.\n","Processing asent: We stood somewhat apart from most of those heading into Besel, between lines of aspirant travellers and on a thin fringe of pavement vehicles travelling slowly.\n","Processing asent: There was, Dhatt was right, something about one of the menbehind us that was disconcerting.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing about his appearance which stood out: he was bundled against the cold in a drab Ul Qoman cloak.\n","Processing asent: But he walked or shuffled towards us somewhat across the directionality of the line of his fellow pedestrians, and I saw behind him disgruntled faces.\n","Processing asent: He was pushing out of his turn, walking towards us.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda saw where we were looking, and gave a little whimper.\n","Processing asent: Come on, Dhatt said, and put his hand to her back and walked her more quickly towards the entrance of the tunnel, but seeing how the figure behind us tried as far as the constraints of those around him would permit to raise his speed as well, to exceed our own, to come towards us, I turned around suddenly and began to move toward him.\n","Processing asent: Get her over there, I said to Dhatt behind me, without looking.\n","Processing asent: Go, get her to the border.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda, go to thepoliczai woman over there.\n","Processing asent: I accelerated.\n","Processing asent: Wait, Yolanda said to me but I heard Dhatt remonstrate with her.\n","Processing asent: I was focused now on the approaching man.\n","Processing asent: He could not fail to see that I was coming towards him, and he hesitated and reached into his jacket, and I fumbled at my side but remembered I had no gun in that city.\n","Processing asent: The man backed up a step or two.\n","Processing asent: The man threw up his hands and unwrapped his scarf.\n","Processing asent: He was shouting my name.\n","Processing asent: It was Bowden.\n","Processing asent: He pulled out something, a pistol dangling in his fingers as if he were allergic to it.\n","Processing asent: I dived for him and heard a hard exhalation behind me.\n","Processing asent: Behind me another spat-out breath and screams.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt shouted and shouted my name.\n","Processing asent: Bowden was staring over my shoulder.\n","Processing asent: I looked behind me.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt was crouched between cars a few metres away.\n","Processing asent: He was wrapping himself up in himself and bellowing.\n","Processing asent: Motorists were hunched in their vehicles.\n","Processing asent: Their screams were spreading to the lines of pedestrian travellers in Besel and in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt huddled over Yolanda.\n","Processing asent: She lay as if tossed.\n","Processing asent: I could not see her clearly, but there was blood across her face.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt was gripping his shoulder.\n","Processing asent: Im hit! he shouted.\n","Processing asent: Yolandas Light, Tyad, shes shot, shes down\n","Processing asent: A commotion started in the hall a long way off.\n","Processing asent: Over the sedately moving traffic I saw at the farthest end of the enormous room a surge in the crowd in Besel, a movement like animal panic.\n","Processing asent: People scattering away from a figure, who leaned on, no, raised, something in both hands.\n","Processing asent: Aiming, a rifle.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Two\n","Processing asent: ANOTHER OF THOSE ABRUPT LITTLE SOUNDS, hardly audible over the rising screams the length of the tunnel.\n","Processing asent: A shot, silenced or muffled by acoustics, but by the time I heard it I was on Bowden and had pushed him down, and the explosive percussion of the bullet into the wall behind him was louder than the shot itself.\n","Processing asent: Architecture sprayed.\n","Processing asent: I heard Bowdens panicked breath, put my hand on his wrist and squeezed until he dropped his weapon, kept him down out of the sightline of the sniper targeting him.\n","Processing asent: Down!\n","Processing asent: Everybody down!\n","Processing asent: I was shouting that.\n","Processing asent: So sluggishly it was hard to believe, the crowds were falling to their knees, their cowering and their screams more and more exaggerated as they realised the danger.\n","Processing asent: Another sound and another, a car braking violently and with an alarm, another implosive gasp as bricks took a bullet.\n","Processing asent: I kept Bowden on the tarmac.\n","Processing asent: Tyad!\n","Processing asent: It was Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Talk to me, I shouted to him.\n","Processing asent: The guards were all over the place, raising weapons, looking everywhere, yelling idiot pointless orders at each other.\n","Processing asent: Im hit, Im okay, he replied.\n","Processing asent: Yolandas head-shot.\n","Processing asent: I looked up, no more firing.\n","Processing asent: I looked up further, to where Dhatt rolled and gripped his wound, to where Yolanda lay dead.\n","Processing asent: Rose slightly more and sawmilitsya approaching Dhatt and the corpse heguarded, and way offpoliczai running towards where the shots had come from.\n","Processing asent: In Besel the police were buffeted and blocked by the hysterical crowd.\n","Processing asent: Corwi was looking in all directionscould she see me?\n","Processing asent: I was shouting.\n","Processing asent: The shooter was running.\n","Processing asent: His way was blocked, but he swung his rifle like a club when he had to, and people were clearing from around him.\n","Processing asent: Orders would be going out to block the entrance, but how fast would they go?\n","Processing asent: He was moving into a part of the crowd who had not seen him shoot, and were surrounding him, and good as he was he would drop or hide his weapon.\n","Processing asent: Goddamn it.\n","Processing asent: I could hardly see him.\n","Processing asent: No one was stopping him.\n","Processing asent: He had some way to go before he was out.\n","Processing asent: I looked, carefully, item by item, at his hair and clothes: cropped; grey tracksuit top with a hood behind; black trousers.\n","Processing asent: All nondescript.\n","Processing asent: Did he drop his weapon?\n","Processing asent: He was into the crowd.\n","Processing asent: I stood holding Bowdens gun.\n","Processing asent: A ridiculous P38, but loaded and well kept.\n","Processing asent: I stepped towards the checkpoint, but there was no way I could get through it, all that chaos, not ever and not now with both lines of guards in uproar flailing guns around; even if my Ul Qoman uniform got me through the Ul Qoman lines, the Bes would stop me, and the shooter was too far for me to catch.\n","Processing asent: I hesitated.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, radio help, watch Bowden, I shouted, then turned and ran the other way, out into Ul Qoma, towards Dhatts car.\n","Processing asent: The crowds got out of my way; they saw me coming with mymilitsya emblazoning, saw the pistol I held, and scattered.\n","Processing asent: Themilitsya saw one of their own, in pursuit of something, and did not stop me. I turned the emergency lights on and started the engine.\n","Processing asent: I sent the car breakneck, dodging local and foreign cars, screaming outside the length of Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: The siren confused me, I was not used to Ul Qoman sirens, aya ya ya more whining than our own cars.\n","Processing asent: The shooter was, must be, fighting his way through the terrified and confused thronging tunnel of travellers.\n","Processing asent: My lights and alarm cleared the roads before me, ostentatiously in Ul Qoma, on the topolganger streets in Besel with the typical unstated panic of a foreign drama.\n","Processing asent: I yanked the wheel and the car snapped right, bumped over Bes tram tracks.\n","Processing asent: Where was Breach?\n","Processing asent: But no breach had occurred.\n","Processing asent: No breach had occurred though a woman had been killed, brazenly, across a border.\n","Processing asent: Assault, a murder and an attempted murder, but those bullets had travelled across the checkpoint itself, in Copula Hall, across the meeting place.\n","Processing asent: A heinous, complex, vicious killing, but in the assiduous care the assassin had takento position himself just so at the point where he could stare openly along the last metres of Besel over the physical border andinto Ul Qoma, could aim precisely down this one conduit between the citiesthat murder had been committed with if anything asurplus of care for the cities boundaries, the membrane between Ul Qoma and Besel.\n","Processing asent: There was no breach, Breach had no power here, and only Bes police were in the same city as the killer now.\n","Processing asent: I turned right again.\n","Processing asent: I was back where we had been an hour before, in Weipay Street in Ul Qoma, which shared the crosshatched latitude-longitude with the Bes entrance to Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: I drove the car as close as the crowds let me, braked hard.\n","Processing asent: I got out and jumped on its roofit would not be long before Ul Qoman police would come to ask me, their supposed colleague, what I was doing, but now I jumped on the roof.\n","Processing asent: After a seconds hesitation I did not stare into the tunnel at the oncoming Bes escaping the attack.\n","Processing asent: I looked instead all around, into Ul Qoma, and then in the direction of the hall, not changing my expression, giving away nothing that suggested that I might be looking anywhere other than at Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I was unimpeachable.\n","Processing asent: The cars stuttering police lights turned my legs red and blue.\n","Processing asent: I let myself notice what was happening in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Many more travellers were still trying to enter Copula Hall than leave it, but as the panic within spread there was a dangerous contraflow.\n","Processing asent: There was commotion, lines backing up, those behind who did not know what it was they had seen or heard blocking those who knew very well and were trying to flee.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qomans unsaw the Bes melee, looked away and crossed the road to avoid the foreign trouble.\n","Processing asent: Get out, get out\n","Processing asent: Let us in, whats ?\n","Processing asent: Among the clots and grots of panicked escapees I saw a hurryingman.\n","Processing asent: He caught my attention by the care with which he tried not to run too fast, not to be too large, to raise his head.\n","Processing asent: I believed it was, then that it was not, then that it was, the shooter.\n","Processing asent: Pushing his way past a last shouting family and a chaotic line of Bespoliczai trying to impose order without knowing what it was they should do.\n","Processing asent: Pushing his way out and turning, walking with his hurried careful step away.\n","Processing asent: I must have made a sound.\n","Processing asent: Certainly those scores of yards away the killer glanced backwards.\n","Processing asent: I saw him see me and reflexively unsee, because of my uniform, because I was in Ul Qoma, but even as he dropped his eyes he recognised something and walked even faster away.\n","Processing asent: I had seen him before, I could not think where.\n","Processing asent: I looked around desperately, but none of thepoliczai in Besel knew to follow him, and I was in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I jumped off the roof of the car and walked quickly after the murderer.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qomans I shoved out of the way: Bes tried to unsee me but had to scurry to get out of my path.\n","Processing asent: I saw their startled looks.\n","Processing asent: I moved faster than the killer.\n","Processing asent: I kept my eyes not on him but looking at some spot or other in Ul Qoma that put him in my field of vision.\n","Processing asent: I tracked him without focusing, just legally.\n","Processing asent: I crossed the plaza and two Ul Qomanmilitsya I passed called some tentative query at me which I ignored.\n","Processing asent: The man must have heard the sound of my step.\n","Processing asent: I had come within a few tens of metres when he turned.\n","Processing asent: His eyes widened in astonishment at the sight of me, which, careful even then, he did not hold.\n","Processing asent: He registered me.\n","Processing asent: He looked back into Besel and sped up, trotting diagonally away toward ErmannStrsz, a high street, behind a Kolyub-bound tram.\n","Processing asent: In Ul Qoma, the road we were on was Saq Umir Way.\n","Processing asent: I accelerated too.\n","Processing asent: He glanced back again and went faster, jogging through the Bes crowds, looking quickly to either side into the cafs lit by coloured candles, into the bookshops of Beselin Ul Qoma these were quieter alleys.\n","Processing asent: He should have entered a shop.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps he did not because there were crosshatched crowds he would have to negotiate on both pavements, perhaps his body rebelled at dead ends, cul-de-sacs, while pursued.\n","Processing asent: He began to run.\n","Processing asent: The murderer ran left, into a smaller alley, where still I followed him.\n","Processing asent: He was fast.\n","Processing asent: He was faster than me now.\n","Processing asent: He ran like a soldier.\n","Processing asent: The distance between us grew.\n","Processing asent: The stallholders and walkers in Bes stared at the killer; those in Ul Qoma stared at me.\n","Processing asent: My quarry vaulted a bin that blocked his way, with greater ease than I knew I would manage.\n","Processing asent: I knew where he was going.\n","Processing asent: The Old Towns of Besel and Ul Qoma are closely crosshatched: reach their edges, separations begin, alter and total areas.\n","Processing asent: This was not, could not be, a chase.\n","Processing asent: It was only two accelerations.\n","Processing asent: We ran, he in his city, me close behind him, full of rage, in mine.\n","Processing asent: I shouted wordlessly.\n","Processing asent: An old woman stared at me. I was not looking at him, I was still not looking at him, but fervently, legally, at Ul Qoma, its lights, graffiti, pedestrians, always at Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: He was by iron rails curled in traditional Bes style.\n","Processing asent: He was too far.\n","Processing asent: He was by a total street, a street in Besel only.\n","Processing asent: He paused to look up in my direction as I gasped for breath.\n","Processing asent: For that sliver of time, too short for him to be accused of any crime, but certainly deliberate, he looked right at me. I knew him, I did not know from where.\n","Processing asent: He looked at me at the threshold to that abroad-only geography and made a tiny triumphant smile.\n","Processing asent: He stepped toward space where no one in Ul Qoma could go.\n","Processing asent: I raised the pistol and shot him.\n","Processing asent: I SHOT HIM IN THE CHEST.\n","Processing asent: I saw his astonishment as he fell.\n","Processing asent: Screaming from everywhere, at the shot, first, then his body and the blood, and almost instantly from all the people who had seen, at the terrible kind of transgression.\n","Processing asent: I thought it was the shocked declaration by those who had witnessed the crime.\n","Processing asent: But unclear figures emerged where there had been no purposeful motion instants before, only the milling of no ones, the aimless and confused, and those suddenly appeared newcomers with faces so motionless I hardly recognised them as faces were saying the word.\n","Processing asent: It was statement of both crime and identity.\n","Processing asent: Breach.\n","Processing asent: A grim-featured something gripped me so that there was no way I could break out, had I wanted to.\n","Processing asent: I glimpsed dark shapes draped over the body of the killer I had killed.\n","Processing asent: A voice close up to my ear.Breach.\n","Processing asent: A force shoving me effortlessly out of my place, fast fast past candles of Besel and the neon of Ul Qoma, in directions that made sense in neither city.\n","Processing asent: Breach, and something touched me and I went under into black, out of waking and all awareness, to the sound of that word.\n","Processing asent: Part Three\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Three\n","Processing asent: IT WAS NOT A SOUNDLESS DARK.\n","Processing asent: It was not without intrusions.\n","Processing asent: There were presences within it that asked me questions I could not answer, questions I was aware of as urgencies at which I failed.\n","Processing asent: Those voices again and again said to me,Breach .\n","Processing asent: What had touched me sent me not into mindless silence but into a dream arena where I was quarry.\n","Processing asent: I REMEMBERED THAT LATER.\n","Processing asent: In the moment I woke it was without a sense of time having passed.\n","Processing asent: I closed my eyes in the crosshatched streets of the Old Towns; I opened them again and gasped for breath and looked into a room.\n","Processing asent: It was grey, without adornment.\n","Processing asent: It was a small room.\n","Processing asent: I was in a bed, no, on it.\n","Processing asent: I lay on top of the sheets in clothes I did not recognise.\n","Processing asent: I sat up.\n","Processing asent: Grey floor in scuffed rubber, a window admitting light at me, tall grey walls, stained in places and cracked.\n","Processing asent: A desk and two chairs.\n","Processing asent: Like a shabby office.\n","Processing asent: A dark glass half-globe in the ceiling.\n","Processing asent: There was no sound at all.\n","Processing asent: I was blinking, standing, nowhere near as groggy as I felt I should have been.\n","Processing asent: The door was locked.\n","Processing asent: The window was too high for meto see through.\n","Processing asent: I jumped up, which did send a little spin through my head, but I saw only sky.\n","Processing asent: The clothes I wore were clean and terribly nondescript.\n","Processing asent: They fit me well enough.\n","Processing asent: I remembered what had been with me in the dark, then, and my heart and my breath began to speed.\n","Processing asent: The soundlessness was enervating.\n","Processing asent: I gripped the lower rim of the window and pulled myself up, my arms trembling.\n","Processing asent: With nothing on which to brace my feet I could not stay in the position long.\n","Processing asent: Roofs spread out below me.\n","Processing asent: The slates, satellite dishes, flat concrete, ajut girders and antennae, the onion domes, corkscrew towers, gasrooms, the backs of what might be gargoyles.\n","Processing asent: I could not tell where I was, nor what might be listening beyond the glass, guarding me from outside.\n","Processing asent: I dropped hard at the voice.\n","Processing asent: I struggled to my feet and turned.\n","Processing asent: Someone stood in the doorway.\n","Processing asent: Light behind him, he was a cutout of darkness, a lack.\n","Processing asent: When he stepped forward he was a man fifteen or twenty years my senior.\n","Processing asent: Tough and squat, in clothes as vague as my own.\n","Processing asent: There were others behind him: a woman my age, another man a little older.\n","Processing asent: Their faces were without anything approaching expressions.\n","Processing asent: They looked like people-shaped clay in the moments before God breathed out.\n","Processing asent: Sit.\n","Processing asent: The older man pointed to a chair.\n","Processing asent: Come out of the corner.\n","Processing asent: It was true.\n","Processing asent: I was flattened into the corner.\n","Processing asent: I realised it.\n","Processing asent: I slowed my lungs and stood straighter.\n","Processing asent: I took my hands away from the walls.\n","Processing asent: I stood like a proper person.\n","Processing asent: After a long time I said, How embarrassing.\n","Processing asent: Then, Excuse me. I sat where the man indicated.\n","Processing asent: When I could control my voice I said, Im Tyador Borl.\n","Processing asent: And you?\n","Processing asent: He sat and looked at me, his head to one side, abstract and curious like a bird.\n","Processing asent: Breach, he said.\n","Processing asent: BREACH, I SAID.\n","Processing asent: I took a shaky breath.\n","Processing asent: Yes, Breach.\n","Processing asent: Finally he said, What were you expecting?\n","Processing asent: What are you expecting?\n","Processing asent: Was that too much?\n","Processing asent: Another time I might have been able to tell.\n","Processing asent: I was looking around nervily as if to catch sight of something almost invisible in the corners.\n","Processing asent: He pointed his right hand at me fork-fingered, index and middle digits one at each of my eyes, then at his own:Look at me .\n","Processing asent: I obeyed.\n","Processing asent: The man glanced at me from under his brows.\n","Processing asent: The situation, he said.\n","Processing asent: I realised we were both speaking Bes.\n","Processing asent: He did not sound quite Bes, nor Ul Qoman, but was certainly not European or North American.\n","Processing asent: His accent was flat.\n","Processing asent: You breached, Tyador Borl.\n","Processing asent: Violently.\n","Processing asent: You killed a man by it.\n","Processing asent: He watched me again.\n","Processing asent: You shot from Ul Qoma right into Besel.\n","Processing asent: So you are in the Breach.\n","Processing asent: He folded his hands together.\n","Processing asent: I watched how his thin bones moved under his skin: just like mine.\n","Processing asent: His name was Yorjavic.\n","Processing asent: The man you killed.\n","Processing asent: Do you remember him?\n","Processing asent: You knew him from before.\n","Processing asent: How do you know?\n","Processing asent: You told us.\n","Processing asent: Its up to us how you go under, how long you stay there, what you see and say while youre there, when you come out again.\n","Processing asent: If you come out.\n","Processing asent: Where did you know him from?\n","Processing asent: I shook my head butThe True Citizens, I said suddenly.\n","Processing asent: He was there when I questioned them.\n","Processing asent: Who had called Gosz the lawyer.\n","Processing asent: One of the tough, cocky nationalist men.\n","Processing asent: He was a soldier, the man said.\n","Processing asent: Six years in the BAF.\n","Processing asent: A sniper.\n","Processing asent: No surprise.\n","Processing asent: It was an amazing shot.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda!\n","Processing asent: I looked up.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: What happened?\n","Processing asent: Senior Detective Dhatt will never fully move his right arm again, but hes recovering.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda Rodriguez is dead.\n","Processing asent: He watched me.\n","Processing asent: What hit Dhatt was intended for her.\n","Processing asent: It was the second shot that went through her head.\n","Processing asent: Goddamn.\n","Processing asent: For seconds I could only look down.\n","Processing asent: Do her family know?\n","Processing asent: They know.\n","Processing asent: Was anyone else hit?\n","Processing asent: Tyador Borl, you breached.\n","Processing asent: Hekilled her.\n","Processing asent: You dont know what else hes\n","Processing asent: The man sat back.\n","Processing asent: I was already nodding an apology, a hopelessness, when he said, Yorjavic didnt breach, Borl.\n","Processing asent: He shot over the border, in Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: He never breached.\n","Processing asent: Lawyers might have an argument: was the crime committed in Besel where he pulled the trigger, or Ul Qoma where the bullets hit?\n","Processing asent: Or both?\n","Processing asent: He held out his hands in an elegantwho cares?\n","Processing asent: He never breached.\n","Processing asent: You did.\n","Processing asent: So you are here, now, in the Breach.\n","Processing asent: WHEN THEY LEFT, food came.\n","Processing asent: Bread, meat, fruit, cheese, water.\n","Processing asent: When I had eaten I pushed and pulled at the door, but there was no way I could move it.\n","Processing asent: I fingertipped its paint, but it was only splitting paint or its messages were in a more arcane code than I could decrypt.\n","Processing asent: Yorjavic was not the first man I had shot, nor even the first I had killed, but I had not killed many.\n","Processing asent: I had never before shot someone not raising a gun at me. I waited for shakes.\n","Processing asent: My heart was slamming but it was with where I was, not guilt.\n","Processing asent: I was alone a long time.\n","Processing asent: I walked the room every way, watched the globe-hidden camera.\n","Processing asent: I pulled myself up to stare out of the window at the roofs again.\n","Processing asent: When the door opened again, it was twilight looking down.\n","Processing asent: The same trio entered.\n","Processing asent: Yorjavic, the older man said, in Bes again.\n","Processing asent: He did breach in one way.\n","Processing asent: When you shot him you made him.\n","Processing asent: Victims of breach always breach.\n","Processing asent: He interacted hard with Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: So we know about him.\n","Processing asent: He had instructions from somewhere.\n","Processing asent: Not from the True Citizens.\n","Processing asent: Heres how it is, he said.\n","Processing asent: You breached, so youre ours.\n","Processing asent: What happens now?\n","Processing asent: Whatever we want.\n","Processing asent: Breach, and you belong to us.\n","Processing asent: They could disappear me without difficulty.\n","Processing asent: There were only rumours about what that would mean.\n","Processing asent: No one ever heard even stories about those who had been taken by Breach andwhat?served their time.\n","Processing asent: Such people must be impressively secretive, or never released.\n","Processing asent: Because you may not see the justice of what we do doesnt mean its unjust, Borl.\n","Processing asent: Think of this, if you want, as your trial.\n","Processing asent: Tell us what you did and why, and we might see ways to performactions.\n","Processing asent: We have to fix a breach.\n","Processing asent: There are investigations to be carried out: we can talk to those who havent breached, if its relevant and we prove it.\n","Processing asent: Understand?\n","Processing asent: There are less and more severe sanctions.\n","Processing asent: We have your record.\n","Processing asent: Youre police.\n","Processing asent: What was he saying?\n","Processing asent: Does that make us colleagues?\n","Processing asent: I did not speak.\n","Processing asent: Why did you do this?\n","Processing asent: Tell us.\n","Processing asent: Tell us about Yolanda Rodriguez, and tell us about Mahalia Geary.\n","Processing asent: I said nothing for a long time but had no plan.\n","Processing asent: You know?\n","Processing asent: What do you know?\n","Processing asent: Whats out there?\n","Processing asent: I pointed at the door.\n","Processing asent: They had left it a little open.\n","Processing asent: You know where you are, he said.\n","Processing asent: Whats out there youll see.\n","Processing asent: Under what conditions depends on what you say and do now.\n","Processing asent: Tell us what got you here.\n","Processing asent: This fools conspiracy thats recurred, for the first time in a long time.\n","Processing asent: Borl, tell us about Orciny.\n","Processing asent: THE SEPIA ILLUMINATIONfrom the corridor was all they let light me, in a wedge, a slice of inadequate glow that kept my interrogator in shade.\n","Processing asent: It took hours to tell them the case.\n","Processing asent: I did not dissemble because they must already know everything.\n","Processing asent: Why did you breach?\n","Processing asent: the man said.\n","Processing asent: I hadnt meant to.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to see where the shooter went.\n","Processing asent: That was breach then.\n","Processing asent: He was in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Yes, but you know.\n","Processing asent: You know that happens all the time.\n","Processing asent: When he smiled, the look he had, I just I was thinking about Mahalia and Yolanda I paced closer to the door.\n","Processing asent: How did he know youd be there?\n","Processing asent: I dont know, I said.\n","Processing asent: Hes a nat, and a crazy one, but hes obviously got contacts.\n","Processing asent: Where isOrciny supposed to be in this?\n","Processing asent: We looked at each other.\n","Processing asent: Ive told you everything I know, I said.\n","Processing asent: I held my face in my hands, looked over my fingertips.\n","Processing asent: It looked as if the man and woman in the doorway werent paying attention.\n","Processing asent: I ran hard at them, I thought without any warning.\n","Processing asent: OneI do notknow whichhooked me in midair and sent me across the room into the wall and down.\n","Processing asent: Someone hit me, the woman it must be, because my head was tugged up and the man stood leaning still in the doorway.\n","Processing asent: The older man sat at the table waiting.\n","Processing asent: The woman straddled my back and held me in some neck-lock.\n","Processing asent: Borl, you are in Breach.\n","Processing asent: This room is where your trial is taking place, the older man said.\n","Processing asent: This can be where its finished.\n","Processing asent: Youre beyond law now; this is where decision lives, and we are it.\n","Processing asent: Once more.\n","Processing asent: Tell us how this case, these people, these murders, connects to this story of Orciny.\n","Processing asent: After many seconds he said to the woman, What are you doing?\n","Processing asent: Hes not choking, she said.\n","Processing asent: I was, so far as her hold would allow, laughing.\n","Processing asent: This isnt about me, I said at last, when I was able.\n","Processing asent: My god.\n","Processing asent: Youre investigating Orciny.\n","Processing asent: There is no such place as Orciny, the man said.\n","Processing asent: So everyone tells me.\n","Processing asent: And yet things keep happening, people keep disappearing or dying, and theres that word again and again, Orciny.\n","Processing asent: The woman got off me. I sat on the floor and shook my head at it all.\n","Processing asent: You know why she never came to you?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: She thoughtyou were Orciny.\n","Processing asent: If you saidHow could there be a place between the city and the city?\n","Processing asent: shed sayDo you believe in the Breach?\n","Processing asent: Wheres that?\n","Processing asent: But she was wrong, wasnt she?\n","Processing asent: Youre not Orciny.\n","Processing asent: There is no Orciny.\n","Processing asent: So why are you asking all this?\n","Processing asent: What have I been running from for days?\n","Processing asent: I justsaw Orciny or something a lot like it shoot my partner.\n","Processing asent: You know Ive breached: what do you care about the rest of it?\n","Processing asent: Why arent you just punishing me?\n","Processing asent: What, this is mercy?\n","Processing asent: Justice?\n","Processing asent: Please.\n","Processing asent: If theres somethingelse between Besel and Ul Qoma, where does that leave you?\n","Processing asent: Youre hunting.\n","Processing asent: Because its suddenly back.\n","Processing asent: You dont know where Orciny is, or whats going on.\n","Processing asent: Youre Hell with it .\n","Processing asent: Youre afraid.\n","Processing asent: THE YOUNGER MAN AND WOMANleft and returned with an old film projector, trailing a lead into the corridor.\n","Processing asent: They fiddled with it and it hummed, and made the wall a screen.\n","Processing asent: It projected scenes from an interrogation.\n","Processing asent: I scooted back to see better, still sitting on the floor.\n","Processing asent: The subject was Bowden.\n","Processing asent: A snap of static and he was speaking in Illitan, and I saw that his interrogators weremilitsya .\n","Processing asent: dont know what happened.\n","Processing asent: Yes,yes I was hiding because someone was coming after me.\n","Processing asent: Someone was trying to kill me.\n","Processing asent: And when I heard Borl and Dhatt were getting out, I didnt know if I could trust them but I thought maybe they could get me out too.\n","Processing asent: have a gun?\n","Processing asent: The voice of the interrogator was muffled.\n","Processing asent: Because someone was trying to kill me, is why.\n","Processing asent: Yes, I had a gun.\n","Processing asent: You can get one on half the street corners in East Ul Qoma, as well you know.\n","Processing asent: Ive lived here for years, you know.\n","Processing asent: Something .\n","Processing asent: Why not?\n","Processing asent: That was audible.\n","Processing asent: Because there isno such thing as Orciny, Bowden said.\n","Processing asent: Something .\n","Processing asent: Well, I dont give a damn what you think, or what Mahalia thought, or what Yolanda said, or what Dhatts been insinuating, and no I have no idea who called me.\n","Processing asent: But theresno such place.\n","Processing asent: A big loud crack of distressed image-sound, and there was Aikam.\n","Processing asent: He was just weeping and weeping.\n","Processing asent: Questions came, and he ignored them to weep.\n","Processing asent: The picture changed again and Dhatt was in Aikams place.\n","Processing asent: He was not in uniform and his arm was in a sling.\n","Processing asent: I fucking do not know, he shouted.\n","Processing asent: Why the fuck are you asking me?\n","Processing asent: Go get Borl, because he seems to have a damn sight more of an idea what the fuck is going on than I do.\n","Processing asent: Orciny?\n","Processing asent: No I fucking dont, because Im not a child, but heres the thing,even though its goddamn obvious Orcinys a pile of shit, something is still going on, people are still getting hold of information they should not be able to, and other people are still being shot in the head by forces unknown.\n","Processing asent: Fucking kids.That is why I agreed to help Borl, illegal be fucked, so if youre going to take my badge go the fuck ahead.\n","Processing asent: Andbe my guestdisbelieve in Orciny all you want, I fucking do.\n","Processing asent: But keep your head down in case that nonexistent fucking city shoots you in the face.\n","Processing asent: Where is Tyador?\n","Processing asent: Whatve you done?\n","Processing asent: The picture went still on the wall.\n","Processing asent: The interrogators looked at me in the light of Dhatts oversized monochrome snarl.\n","Processing asent: So, the older man said.\n","Processing asent: He nodded at the wall.\n","Processing asent: You heard Bowden.\n","Processing asent: Whats happening.\n","Processing asent: What do you know about Orciny?\n","Processing asent: THE BREACH WAS NOTHING.\n","Processing asent: It is nothing.\n","Processing asent: This is a commonplace; this is simple stuff.\n","Processing asent: The Breach has no embassies, no army, no sights to see.\n","Processing asent: The Breach has no currency.\n","Processing asent: If you commit it it will envelop you.\n","Processing asent: Breach is void full of angry police.\n","Processing asent: This trail that led and led again to Orciny suggested systemic transgression, secret para-rules, a parasite city where there should be nothing but nothing, nothing but Breach.\n","Processing asent: If Breach was not Orciny, what would it be but a mockery of itself, to have let that go for centuries?\n","Processing asent: That was why my questioner, when he asked meDoes Orciny exist?\n","Processing asent: , put it like this, So, are we at war?\n","Processing asent: I brought our collaboration to their attention.\n","Processing asent: I, daring, bargained.\n","Processing asent: Ill help you I kept saying, with a drawn-out pause, an ellipsis implyingif .\n","Processing asent: I wanted the killers of Mahalia Geary and Yolanda Rodriguez and they could tell that, but I was not too noble to bargain.\n","Processing asent: That there was room to barter, a way, a small chance that I might get out of Breach again, was intoxicating.\n","Processing asent: YOU ALMOST CAMEfor me once before, I said.\n","Processing asent: They had been watching, when I came grosstopically close to my house.\n","Processing asent: So are we partners?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Youre a breacher.\n","Processing asent: But itll go better if you help us.\n","Processing asent: You really think Orciny killed them?\n","Processing asent: the other man said.\n","Processing asent: Would they finish with me when there was even a possibility that Orciny was here, emerging, and still unfound?\n","Processing asent: Its population walking the streets, unseen by the populations of Besel and Ul Qoma, each thinking they were in the other.\n","Processing asent: Hiding like books in a library.\n","Processing asent: What is it?\n","Processing asent: the woman said, seeing my face.\n","Processing asent: Ive told you what I know, and its not much.\n","Processing asent: Its Mahalia who really knew what was happening, and shes dead.\n","Processing asent: But she left something behind.\n","Processing asent: She told a friend.\n","Processing asent: She told Yolanda that shed realised the truth when she was going through her notes.\n","Processing asent: We never found anything like that.\n","Processing asent: But I know how she worked.\n","Processing asent: I know where they are.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Four\n","Processing asent: WE LEFT THE BUILDINGthe station, call itin the morning, me in the company of the older man, Breach, and I realised I did not know what city we were in.\n","Processing asent: I had stayed up much of the night watching films of interrogations, from Ul Qoma and from Besel.\n","Processing asent: A Bes border guard and an Ul Qoman, passersby from both cities who knew nothing.\n","Processing asent: People started screaming Motorists over whom bullets had gone.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, I said, when her face appeared on the wall.\n","Processing asent: So where is he?\n","Processing asent: A quirk of recording made her voice far away.\n","Processing asent: She was angry and controlling herself.\n","Processing asent: What the fuck has boss-man got himself into?\n","Processing asent: Yes, he wanted me to help him get someone through.\n","Processing asent: That was all they established, repeatedly, her Bes questioners.\n","Processing asent: They threatened her job.\n","Processing asent: She was as contemptuous of that as Dhatt, though more careful how she phrased it.\n","Processing asent: She knew nothing.\n","Processing asent: Breach showed me brief shots of someone questioning Biszaya and Sariska.\n","Processing asent: Biszaya cried.\n","Processing asent: Im not impressed with this, I said.\n","Processing asent: This is just cruel.\n","Processing asent: The most interesting films were those of Yorjavics comrades among the extreme nationalists of Besel.\n","Processing asent: I recognised some who had been with Yorjavic.\n","Processing asent: They stared sulky at their questioners, thepoliczai .\n","Processing asent: A few refused to speak except in the company of theirlawyers.\n","Processing asent: There was hard questioning, an officer leaning across the table and punching a man in the face.\n","Processing asent: Fucks sake, the bleeding man shouted.\n","Processing asent: Were on the same fucking side, you fuck.\n","Processing asent: Youre Bes, youre not fucking Ul Qoman and youre not fucking Breach\n","Processing asent: With arrogance, neutrality, resentment or, often, compliance and collaboration, the nationalists denied any knowledge of Yorjavics action.\n","Processing asent: Ive never fucking heard of this foreign woman; he never mentioned her.\n","Processing asent: Shes a student?\n","Processing asent: one said.\n","Processing asent: We do whats right for Besel, you know?\n","Processing asent: And you dont have to know why.\n","Processing asent: But The man we watched agonised with his hands, made shapes to try to explain himself without recrimination.\n","Processing asent: Were fucking soldiers.\n","Processing asent: Like you.\n","Processing asent: For Besel.\n","Processing asent: So if you hear that something has to be done, if you get instructions, like someone has to be warned, reds or unifs or traitors or UQ or the fucking Breach-lickers are gathering or whatever, something has to be done, okay.\n","Processing asent: But you know why.\n","Processing asent: You dont ask, but you can see its got to be done, most of the time.\n","Processing asent: But I dont know why this Rodriguez girl I dont believe he did and if hedid I dont He looked angry.\n","Processing asent: I dont know why.\n","Processing asent: Of course they have contacts in the deep state, my Breach interlocutor said.\n","Processing asent: But with something as hard to parse as this, you can see the possibility, that Yorjavic maybe wasnt a True Citizen.\n","Processing asent: Or not only, but a representative of a more hidden organisation.\n","Processing asent: A more hidden place maybe, I said.\n","Processing asent: I thought you watched everything.\n","Processing asent: No one breached.\n","Processing asent: He put papers in front of me.\n","Processing asent: Those are the findings of the Beselpoliczai who searched Yorjavics apartment.\n","Processing asent: Nothing linking him to anything like Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Tomorrow were leaving early.\n","Processing asent: How did you get all this?\n","Processing asent: I said as he and his companions stood.\n","Processing asent: He looked at me with a motionless but withering face as he left.\n","Processing asent: HE RETURNED AFTER A SHORT NIGHT, alone this time.\n","Processing asent: I was ready for him.\n","Processing asent: I waved the papers.\n","Processing asent: Presuming my colleagues did a good job, theres nothing.\n","Processing asent: A few payments come in time to time, but not that muchcould be anything.\n","Processing asent: He passed the exam a few years back, could crossnot so unusual, although with his politics I shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Subscriptions, bookshelves, associates, army record, criminal record, hangouts, and all that mark him out as a run-of-the-mill violent nat.\n","Processing asent: Breach has watched him.\n","Processing asent: Like all dissidents.\n","Processing asent: Theres been no sign of unusual connections.\n","Processing asent: Orciny, you mean.\n","Processing asent: He ushered me finally out of the room.\n","Processing asent: The corridor had the same scabbing paint, a worn colourless carpet, a succession of doors.\n","Processing asent: I heard the steps of others, and as we turned into a stairwell a woman passed us, with a moments acknowledgement to my companion.\n","Processing asent: Then a man passed, and then we were in a hallway with several other people.\n","Processing asent: What they wore would be legal in either Besel or in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I heard conversation in both languages and a third thing, a mongrel or antique that combined them.\n","Processing asent: I heard typing.\n","Processing asent: I never considered rushing or attacking my companion and trying to escape.\n","Processing asent: I admit that.\n","Processing asent: I was very observed.\n","Processing asent: On the walls of an office we passed were corkboards thick with memos, shelves of folders.\n","Processing asent: A woman tore paper from a printer.\n","Processing asent: A telephone rang.\n","Processing asent: Come on, the man said.\n","Processing asent: You said you know where the truth is.\n","Processing asent: There were double doors, doors to an outside.\n","Processing asent: We stepped through, and that, when the light ate me up, was when I realised I did not know which city we were in.\n","Processing asent: AFTER PANIC AT THE CROSSHATCH, I realised we must be in Ul Qoma: that was where our destination was.\n","Processing asent: I followed my escort down the street.\n","Processing asent: I was breathing deep.\n","Processing asent: It was morning, noisy, overcast but withoutrain, boisterous.\n","Processing asent: Cold: the air made me gasp.\n","Processing asent: I was pleasantly disoriented by all the people, by the motion of coated Ul Qomans, the growl of cars moving slowly on this mostly pedestrian street, the shouts of hawkers, the sellers of clothes and books and food.\n","Processing asent: I unsaw all else.\n","Processing asent: There was the thrum of cables above us as one of the Ul Qoman inflates butted against the wind.\n","Processing asent: I dont need to tell you not to run, the man said.\n","Processing asent: I dont need to tell you not to shout.\n","Processing asent: You know I can stop you.\n","Processing asent: And you know Im not alone in watching you.\n","Processing asent: Youre in Breach.\n","Processing asent: Call me Ashil.\n","Processing asent: You know my name.\n","Processing asent: While youre with me youre Tye.\n","Processing asent: Tye, like Ashil, was not traditional Bes, nor Ul Qoman, could just plausibly be either.\n","Processing asent: Ashil walked me across a courtyard, below facades of figures and bells, video screens with stock information.\n","Processing asent: I did not know where we were.\n","Processing asent: Youre hungry, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: I can wait.\n","Processing asent: He steered me to a side street, another crosshatched side street where Ul Qoman stalls by a supermarket offered software and knickknacks.\n","Processing asent: He took my arm and guided me, and I hesitated because there was no food in sight except, and I pulled against him a moment, there were dumpling stations and bread stalls, but they were in Besel.\n","Processing asent: I tried to unsee them but there could be no uncertainty: that source of the smell I had been unsmelling was our destination.\n","Processing asent: Walk, he said, and he walked me through the membrane between cities; I lifted my foot in Ul Qoma, put it down again in Besel, where breakfast was.\n","Processing asent: Behind us was an Ul Qoman woman with raspberry punk hair selling the unlocking of mobile phones.\n","Processing asent: She glanced in surprise then consternation; then I saw her quickly unsee us as Ashil ordered food in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Ashil paid with Besmarques.\n","Processing asent: He put the paper plate in my hand, walked me back across the road into the supermarket.\n","Processing asent: It was in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: He bought a carton of orange juice with dinar, gave it to me.\n","Processing asent: I held the food and the drink.\n","Processing asent: He walked me down the middle of the crosshatched road.\n","Processing asent: My sight seemed to untether as with a lurching Hitchcock shot, some trickery of dolly and depth of field, so the street lengthened and its focus changed.\n","Processing asent: Everything I had been unseeing now jostled into sudden close-up.\n","Processing asent: Sound and smell came in: the calls of Besel; the ringing of its clocktowers; the clattering and old metal percussion of the trams; the chimney smell; the old smells; they came in a tide with the spice and Illitan yells of Ul Qoma, the clatter of amilitsya copter, the gunning of German cars.\n","Processing asent: The colours of Ul Qoma light and plastic window displays no longer effaced the ochres and stone of its neighbour, my home.\n","Processing asent: Where are you?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: He spoke so only I could hear.\n","Processing asent: Are you in Besel or Ul Qoma?\n","Processing asent: Neither.\n","Processing asent: Im in Breach.\n","Processing asent: Youre with me here.\n","Processing asent: We moved through a crosshatched morning crowd.\n","Processing asent: In Breach.\n","Processing asent: No one knows if theyre seeing you or unseeing you.\n","Processing asent: Dont creep.\n","Processing asent: Youre not in neither: youre in both.\n","Processing asent: He tapped my chest.\n","Processing asent: Breathe.\n","Processing asent: HE TOOK US BY METRO IN ULQoma, where I sat still as if the remnants of Besel clung to me like cobwebs and would frighten fellow passengers, out and onto a tram in Besel, and it felt good, as if I were back home, misleadingly.\n","Processing asent: We went by foot through either city.\n","Processing asent: The feeling of Besel familiarity was replaced by some larger strangeness.\n","Processing asent: We stopped by the glass-and-steel frontage of UQ University Library.\n","Processing asent: What would you do if I ran?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: He said nothing.\n","Processing asent: Ashil took out a nondescript leather holder and showed the guard the sigil of Breach.\n","Processing asent: The man stared at it for seconds, then jumped to his feet.\n","Processing asent: My God, he said.\n","Processing asent: He was an immigrant, from Turkey judging from his Illitan, but he had been here long enough to understand what he saw.\n","Processing asent: I, you, what can I ?\n","Processing asent: Ashil pointed him back to his chair and walked on.\n","Processing asent: The library was newer than its Bes counterpart.\n","Processing asent: It will have no classmark, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Thats the point, I said.\n","Processing asent: We referred to the map and its legend.\n","Processing asent: The histories of Besel and Ul Qoma, carefully separately listed but shelved close to each other, were on the fourth floor.\n","Processing asent: The students in their carrels looked at Ashil as he passed.\n","Processing asent: There was in him an authority unlike that of parents or tutors.\n","Processing asent: Many of the titles we stood before were not translated, were in their original English or French.The Secrets of the Precursor Age; The Literal and the Littoral: Besel, Ul Qoma and Maritime Semiotics .\n","Processing asent: We scanned for minutesthere were many shelves.\n","Processing asent: What I was looking for, and there at last on the second-to-top shelf three rows back from the main walkway found, pushing past a confused young undergraduate as if I were the one with authority here, was a book marked by lack.\n","Processing asent: It was unadorned at the bottom of its spine with a printed category mark.\n","Processing asent: Here.\n","Processing asent: The same edition I had had.\n","Processing asent: That psychedelic doors-of-perception-style illustration, a long-haired man walking a street made patchwork from two different (and spurious) architectural styles, from the shadows of which watched eyes.\n","Processing asent: I opened it in front of Ashil.Between the City and the City .\n","Processing asent: Markedly worn.\n","Processing asent: If all this is true, I said quietly, then were being watched.\n","Processing asent: You and me, now.\n","Processing asent: I pointed to one of the pairs of eyes on the cover.\n","Processing asent: I riffled the pages.\n","Processing asent: Ink flickers, most pages annotated in tiny scrawl: red, black, and blue.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia had written in an extra-fine nib, and her notes were like tangled hair, years of annotations of the occult thesis.\n","Processing asent: I glanced behind me, and Ashil did the same.\n","Processing asent: No one was there.\n","Processing asent: NO , we read in her hand.NOT AT ALL , andREALLY?\n","Processing asent: CF HARRIS ET AL , andLUNACY!!\n","Processing asent: MAD!!! and so on.\n","Processing asent: Ashil took it from me.\n","Processing asent: She understood Orciny better than anyone, I said.\n","Processing asent: Thats where she kept the truth.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Five\n","Processing asent: THEYVE BOTH BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUTwhats happened to you, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Corwi and Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: What did you tell them?\n","Processing asent: A look:We dont speak to them at all .\n","Processing asent: That evening he brought me colour copies, bound, of every page, and inside and outside covers, of Mahalias Ul Qoma copy ofBetween .\n","Processing asent: This was her notebook.\n","Processing asent: With effort and attention, I could follow a particular line of reasoning from each tangled page, could track each of her readings in turn.\n","Processing asent: That evening Ashil walked with me in that both-cities.\n","Processing asent: The sweep and curves of Ul Qoman byzanterie ajut over and around the lowmittel continental and middle-history brickwork of Besel, its bas-relief figures of scarfed women and bombardiers, Besels steamed food and dark breads fugging with the hot smells of Ul Qoma, colours of light and cloth around grey and basalt tones, sounds now both abrupt, schwa-staccatoed-sinuousand throaty swallowing.\n","Processing asent: Being in both cities had gone from being in Besel and Ul Qoma to being in a third place, that nowhere-both, that Breach.\n","Processing asent: Everyone, in both cities, seemed tense.\n","Processing asent: We had returned through the two crosshatched cities not to the offices where I had wokenthey were in Rusai Bey in Ul Qoma or TushasProspekta in Besel, I had back-figured-outbut to another, a middling-smart apartment with a concierges office, not too far from that larger HQ.\n","Processing asent: On the top floor the rooms extended across what must be two or three buildings, and in the warrens of that, Breach came and went.\n","Processing asent: There were anonymous bedrooms, kitchens, offices, outdated-looking computers, phones, locked cabinets.\n","Processing asent: Terse men and women.\n","Processing asent: As the two cities had grown together, places, spaces had opened between them, or failed to be claimed, or been those controversialdissensi .\n","Processing asent: Breach lived there.\n","Processing asent: What if you get burgled?\n","Processing asent: Doesnt that happen?\n","Processing asent: Time to time.\n","Processing asent: Then theyre in Breach, and theyre ours.\n","Processing asent: The women and men stayed busy, carrying out conversations that fluctuated through Bes, Illitan, and the third form.\n","Processing asent: The featureless bedroom into which Ashil put me had bars on its windows, another camera somewhere, for sure.\n","Processing asent: There was an en-suite toilet.\n","Processing asent: He did not leave.\n","Processing asent: Another two or three Breach joined us.\n","Processing asent: Look at this, I said.\n","Processing asent: Youre evidence this could all be real.\n","Processing asent: The interstitiality which made Orciny so absurd to most citizens of Besel and Ul Qoma was not only possible but inevitable.\n","Processing asent: Why would Breach disbelieve life could thrive in that little gap?\n","Processing asent: The anxiety was now rather something likeWe have never seen them , a very different concern.\n","Processing asent: It cant be, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Ask your superiors.\n","Processing asent: Ask the powers.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: What other, higher or lower, powers were there in Breach?\n","Processing asent: You know were watched.\n","Processing asent: Or they wereMahalia, Yolanda, Bowdenby something somewhere.\n","Processing asent: Theres nothing linking the shooter to anything.\n","Processing asent: That was one of the others, speaking Illitan.\n","Processing asent: Alright.\n","Processing asent: I shrugged.\n","Processing asent: I spoke in Bes.\n","Processing asent: So he was just a random, very lucky right-winger.\n","Processing asent: If you say so.\n","Processing asent: Or maybe you think its insiles, doing this?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: None of them denied the existence of the fabled scavenging interstitial refugees.\n","Processing asent: They used Mahalia, andwhen they were done they killed her.\n","Processing asent: They killed Yolanda, in a way exactly so you couldnt chase them.\n","Processing asent: As if of all the things in Besel, Ul Qoma, or anywhere, what theyre most scared of is Breach.\n","Processing asent: Buta woman pointed at melook what you did.\n","Processing asent: Breached?\n","Processing asent: I had given them a way in to whatever this war was.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: What did Mahalia know?\n","Processing asent: She worked something out about what they had planned.\n","Processing asent: They killed her.\n","Processing asent: The overlaid glimmer of nighttime Ul Qoma and Besel lit me through the window.\n","Processing asent: I made my ominous point to a growing audience of Breach, their faces like owls.\n","Processing asent: They locked me in overnight.\n","Processing asent: I read Mahalias annotations.\n","Processing asent: I could discern phases of annotation, though not in any pagewise chronologyall the notes were layered, a palimpsest of evolving interpretation.\n","Processing asent: I did archaeology.\n","Processing asent: Early on, in the lowest layers of marks, her handwriting was more careful, the notes longer and neater, with more references to other writers and to her own essays.\n","Processing asent: Her idiolect and unorthodox abbreviations made it hard to be sure.\n","Processing asent: I started page on page trying to read, transcribe, those early thoughts.\n","Processing asent: Mostly what I discerned was her anger.\n","Processing asent: I felt a something-stretched-out over the night streets.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to talk to those I had known in Besel or Ul Qoma, but I could only watch.\n","Processing asent: Whatever unseen bosses, if any, waited in the Breachs bowels, it was Ashil who came for me again the next morning, found me going over and over those notes.\n","Processing asent: He led me the length of a corridor to an office.\n","Processing asent: I imagined runningno one seemed to be watching me.\n","Processing asent: They would stop me, though.\n","Processing asent: And if they did not, where would I go, hunted in-betweener refugee?\n","Processing asent: There were twelve or so Breach in the cramped room, sitting, standing, precarious on the edge of desks, low muttering in two or three languages.\n","Processing asent: A discussion midway.\n","Processing asent: Why was I shown this?\n","Processing asent: Gosharian says it hasnt, he just called\n","Processing asent: What about SusurStrsz?\n","Processing asent: Wasnt there some talk ?\n","Processing asent: Yes, but everyones accounted for.\n","Processing asent: This was a crisis meeting.\n","Processing asent: Mutterings into phones, quick checks against lists.\n","Processing asent: Ashil said to me, Things are moving.\n","Processing asent: More people came and joined the talk.\n","Processing asent: What now?\n","Processing asent: The question, spoken by a young woman wearing the headscarf of a married Besel woman from a traditional family, was addressed to me, prisoner, condemned, consultant.\n","Processing asent: I recognised her from the previous night.\n","Processing asent: Silence went through the room, leaving itself behind, with all the people watching me.\n","Processing asent: Tell me again about when Mahalia was taken, she said.\n","Processing asent: Are you trying to close in on Orciny?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I had nothing to suggest to her, though something felt close to my reach.\n","Processing asent: They continued their quick back-and-forth, using shorthands and slang I did not know, but I could tell they were debating each other, and I tried to understand over whatsome strategy, some question of direction.\n","Processing asent: Periodically everyone in the room murmured something final-sounding and paused, and raised or did not raise a hand, and glanced around to count how many did which.\n","Processing asent: We have to understand what got us here, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: What would you do to find out what Mahalia knew?\n","Processing asent: His comrades were growing agitated, interrupting each other.\n","Processing asent: I recalled Jaris and Yolanda talking about Mahalias anger at the end.\n","Processing asent: I sat up hard.\n","Processing asent: What is it?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: We need to go to the dig.\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: He regarded me.\n","Processing asent: Ready with Tye, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Coming with me.\n","Processing asent: Three-quarters of the room raised their hands briefly.\n","Processing asent: Said my piece about him, said the headscarfed woman, who did not raise hers.\n","Processing asent: Heard, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: But.\n","Processing asent: He pointed her eyes around the room.\n","Processing asent: She had lost a vote.\n","Processing asent: I left with Ashil.\n","Processing asent: It was there on the streets, that something fraught.\n","Processing asent: You feel this?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: He even nodded.\n","Processing asent: I need can I call Dhatt?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Hes still on leave.\n","Processing asent: And if you see him\n","Processing asent: Youre in Breach.\n","Processing asent: Easier for him if you leave him alone.\n","Processing asent: Youllsee people you know.\n","Processing asent: Dont put them in positions.\n","Processing asent: They need to know where you are.\n","Processing asent: Hes under surveillance bymilitsya .\n","Processing asent: For his protection.\n","Processing asent: No one in Besel or Ul Qoma can find any link between Yorjavic and him.\n","Processing asent: Whoever tried to kill him\n","Processing asent: Are we still saying its not Orciny?\n","Processing asent: Theres no Orciny?\n","Processing asent: might try again.\n","Processing asent: The leaders of True Citizens are with thepoliczai .\n","Processing asent: But if Yorj and any other of their members were some secret cell, they dont seem to know.\n","Processing asent: Theyre angry about it.\n","Processing asent: You saw the film.\n","Processing asent: Where are we?\n","Processing asent: Which way is the dig?\n","Processing asent: HE TOOK US BY THAT AWESOME SUCCESSIONof breaching transport, worming through the two cities, leaving a tunnel of Breach in the shape of our journey.\n","Processing asent: I wondered where he carried what weapon.\n","Processing asent: The guard at the gate of Bol Yean recognised me and smiled a smile that quickly faltered.\n","Processing asent: He had perhaps heard I had disappeared.\n","Processing asent: Were not approaching the academics, were not questioning the students, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: You understand were here to investigate the background to and terms of your breach.\n","Processing asent: I was police on my own crime.\n","Processing asent: It would be easier if we could talk to Nancy.\n","Processing asent: None of the academics, none of the students.\n","Processing asent: Begin.\n","Processing asent: You know who I am?\n","Processing asent: This to the guard.\n","Processing asent: We went to Buidze, who stood with his back to the wall of his office, stared at us, at Ashil in great and straightforward fear, at me in fear that was more bewildered:Can I speak of what we spoke of before?\n","Processing asent: I saw him think,Who is he?\n","Processing asent: Ashil manoeuvred me with him to the back of the room, found a shaft of shadow.\n","Processing asent: I havent breached, Buidze kept whispering.\n","Processing asent: Do you invite investigation?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Your jobs to stop smuggling, I said.\n","Processing asent: Buidze nodded.\n","Processing asent: What was I?\n","Processing asent: Neither he nor I knew.\n","Processing asent: Hows that going?\n","Processing asent: Holy Light Please.\n","Processing asent: The only way any of these kids could do it would be to slip a memento straight in their pockets from the ground, so it never gets catalogued, and they cant because everyones searched when they leave the site.\n","Processing asent: No one could sell this stuff anyway.\n","Processing asent: Like I said, the kids go for walks around the site, and they might be breaching when they stand still.\n","Processing asent: What can you do?\n","Processing asent: Cant prove it.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt mean theyre thieves.\n","Processing asent: She told Yolanda you could be a thief without knowing it, I said to Ashil.\n","Processing asent: At the end.\n","Processing asent: What have you lost?\n","Processing asent: I asked Buidze.\n","Processing asent: He took us to the artefact warehouse, stumbling eager to help us.\n","Processing asent: On the way two students I somewhat recognised saw us, stopped stillsomething about Ashils gait, that I was mimickingbacked away.\n","Processing asent: There were the cabinets where the finds were, in which the latest dusted-off things born from the ground were stored.\n","Processing asent: Lockers full of the impossible variety of Precursor Age debris, a miraculous and obstinately opaque rubble of bottles, orreries, axe heads, parchment scraps.\n","Processing asent: Goes in, whoevers in charge that night makes sure everyone puts whatevers been found away, locks up, leaves the key.\n","Processing asent: Doesnt get out the grounds without we search them.\n","Processing asent: They dont even give us shit about that; they know thats how it is.\n","Processing asent: I motioned Buidze to open the cabinet.\n","Processing asent: I looked into the collection, each piece nestled in its little house, its segment of polystyrene, in the drawer.\n","Processing asent: The topmost drawers had not yet been filled.\n","Processing asent: Those below were full.\n","Processing asent: Some of the fragile pieces were wrapped in lint-free cloth, swaddled from view.\n","Processing asent: I opened the drawers one below the other, examining the ranked findings.\n","Processing asent: Ashil came to stand beside me and looked down into the last as if it were a teacup, as if the artefacts were leaves with which one could divine.\n","Processing asent: Who has the keys each night?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: I, I, it depends.\n","Processing asent: Buidzes fear of us was wearing, but I did not believe he would lie.\n","Processing asent: Whoever.\n","Processing asent: Its not important.\n","Processing asent: They all do it sometimes.\n","Processing asent: Whoevers working late.\n","Processing asent: Theres a schedule, but theyre always ignoring it\n","Processing asent: After theyve given the keys back to security, they leave?\n","Processing asent: Straightaway?\n","Processing asent: Yeah.\n","Processing asent: Usually.\n","Processing asent: They might go to their office a bit, walk in the grounds, but they dont usually stick around.\n","Processing asent: The grounds?\n","Processing asent: Its a park.\n","Processing asent: Its nice.\n","Processing asent: He shrugged helpless.\n","Processing asent: Theres no way out, though; its alter a few metres in, they have to come back through here.\n","Processing asent: They dont leave without being searched.\n","Processing asent: When did Mahalia last lock up?\n","Processing asent: Loads of times.\n","Processing asent: I dont know\n","Processing asent: Last time.\n","Processing asent: The night she disappeared, he said at last.\n","Processing asent: Give me a list of who did it when.\n","Processing asent: I cant!\n","Processing asent: They keep one, but like I say half the time they just do each other favours\n","Processing asent: I opened the lowest drawers.\n","Processing asent: Between the tiny crude figures, the intricate Precursor lingams and ancient pipettes, there were deli-cats wrapped.\n","Processing asent: I touched the shapes gently.\n","Processing asent: Those are old, Buidze said, watching me.\n","Processing asent: They were dug up ages ago.\n","Processing asent: I see, I said, reading the labels.\n","Processing asent: They had been disinterred in the early days of the dig.\n","Processing asent: I turned at the sound of Professor Nancy entering.\n","Processing asent: She stopped hard, stared at Ashil, at me.\n","Processing asent: She opened her mouth.\n","Processing asent: She had lived in Ul Qoma many years, was trained to see its minutiae.\n","Processing asent: She recognised what she saw.\n","Processing asent: Professor, I said.\n","Processing asent: She nodded.\n","Processing asent: She stared at Buidze and he at her.\n","Processing asent: She nodded and backed out.\n","Processing asent: When Mahalia was in charge of the keys, she went for walks after locking up, didnt she?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Buidze shrugged, bewildered.\n","Processing asent: She offered to lock up when it wasnt her turn, too.\n","Processing asent: More than once.\n","Processing asent: All the small artefacts were in their cloth-lined beds.\n","Processing asent: I did not rummage, but I felt around at the rear of the drawer without what I imagined was the preferred care.\n","Processing asent: He shifted, but Buidze would not challenge me.\n","Processing asent: At the rear of the third shelf up, of things brought to light still more than a year ago, one of the cloth-wrapped items gave under my finger in a way that made me pause.\n","Processing asent: You have to wear gloves, Buidze said.\n","Processing asent: I unwrapped it and within was newspaper, and in the twist of paper was a piece of wood still flecked with paint and marked by where screws had held it.\n","Processing asent: Not ancient nor carved: the offcut of a door, an absolute piece of nothing.\n","Processing asent: Buidze stared.\n","Processing asent: I held it up.\n","Processing asent: What dynastys this?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Dont, said Ashil to me.\n","Processing asent: He followed me out.\n","Processing asent: Buidze came behind us.\n","Processing asent: Im Mahalia, I said.\n","Processing asent: Ive just locked up.\n","Processing asent: Ive just volunteered to do it, though its someone elses turn.\n","Processing asent: Now a little walk.\n","Processing asent: I marched us out into the open air, past the carefully layered hole where students glanced at us in surprise, on into the wasteland, where there was that rubble of history, and beyond it out of the gate that would open to a university ID, that opened for us because of where and what we were, that we propped open, into the park.\n","Processing asent: Not much of a park this close to the excavation, but scrub and a few trees crossed by paths.\n","Processing asent: There were Ul Qomans visible, but none too close.\n","Processing asent: There was no unbroken Ul Qoman space between the dig and the bulk of the Ul Qoman park.\n","Processing asent: Besel intruded.\n","Processing asent: We saw other figures at the edges of the clearing: Bes sitting on the rocks or by the crosshatched pond.\n","Processing asent: The park was only slightly in Besel, a few metres at the edge of vegetation, a rill of crossover in paths and bushes, and a little stretch of totality cutting the two Ul Qoman sections off from each other.\n","Processing asent: Maps made clear to walkers where they might go.\n","Processing asent: It was here in the crosshatch that the students might stand, scandalously, touching distance from a foreign power, a pornography of separation.\n","Processing asent: Breach watches fringes like this, Ashil said to me.\n","Processing asent: There are cameras.\n","Processing asent: Wed see anyone emerge into Besel who didnt come in by it.\n","Processing asent: Buidze was hanging back.\n","Processing asent: Ashil spoke so he could not hear.\n","Processing asent: Buidze was trying not to watch us.\n","Processing asent: I paced.\n","Processing asent: Orciny I said.\n","Processing asent: No way in or out of here in Ul Qoma but back through Bol Yean dig.Dissensi?\n","Processing asent: Bullshit.\n","Processing asent: Thats not how she delivered.\n","Processing asent: This is what she was doing.\n","Processing asent: Have you seenThe Great Escape?\n","Processing asent: I walked to the edge of the crosshatched zone, where Ul Qoma ended for metres.\n","Processing asent: Of course I was in Breach now, could wanderon into Besel if I wanted, but I stopped as if I were only in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I walked to the edge of the space it shared with Besel, where Besel became briefly total and separated it from the rest of Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I made sure Ashil was watching me. I mimed placing the piece of wood in my pocket, stuffing it in fact down past my belt, down the inside of my trousers.\n","Processing asent: Hole in her pockets.\n","Processing asent: I walked a few steps in the crosshatch, dropping the thankfully unsplintering wood down my leg.\n","Processing asent: I stood still when it hit the ground.\n","Processing asent: I stood as if contemplating the skyline and moved my feet gently, letting it onto the earth, where I trod it in and scuffed plant muck and dirt onto it.\n","Processing asent: When I walked away, without looking back, the wood was a nothing shape, invisible if you did not know it was there.\n","Processing asent: When she goes, someone in Beselor someone who looks like they are, so theres nothing for you to noticecomes by, I said.\n","Processing asent: Stands and looks at the sky.\n","Processing asent: Kicks their heels.\n","Processing asent: Kicks something up.\n","Processing asent: Sits on a rock for a moment, touches the ground, puts something in their pocket.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia wouldnt take the recent stuff because it was just put away, much too noticeable.\n","Processing asent: But while shes locking up, because it only takes a second, she opens theold drawers.\n","Processing asent: What does she take?\n","Processing asent: Maybe its random.\n","Processing asent: Maybe shes following instructions.\n","Processing asent: Bol Yean searches them every night, so why would they think anyones stealing?\n","Processing asent: She never had anything on her.\n","Processing asent: It was sitting here in the crosshatch.\n","Processing asent: Where someone came to take it.\n","Processing asent: Through Besel.\n","Processing asent: I turned and looked slowly in all directions.\n","Processing asent: Do you feel watched?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: A very long quiet.\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: Orciny.\n","Processing asent: I turned again.\n","Processing asent: Im tired of this.\n","Processing asent: I stood.\n","Processing asent: Really.\n","Processing asent: I turned.\n","Processing asent: This is wearing.\n","Processing asent: What are you thinking?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: A noise of a dog in the woods made us look up.\n","Processing asent: The dog was in Besel.\n","Processing asent: I was ready to unhear, but of course I did not have to.\n","Processing asent: It was a lab, a friendly dark animal that sniffed out of the undergrowth and trotted to us.\n","Processing asent: Ashil held out his hand for it.\n","Processing asent: Its owner emerged, smiled, started, looked away in confusion and called his dog to heel.\n","Processing asent: It went to him, looking back at us.\n","Processing asent: He was trying to unsee, but the man could not forebear looking at us, wondering probably why we would risk playing with an animal in such an unstable urban location.\n","Processing asent: When Ashil met his eye the man looked away.\n","Processing asent: He must have been able to tell where and so what we were.\n","Processing asent: ACCORDING TO THE CATALOGUEthe wood offcut was a replacement for a brass tube containing gears encrusted into position by centuries.\n","Processing asent: Three other pieces were missing, from those early digs, all from within wrappings, all replaced by twists of paper, stones, the leg of a doll.\n","Processing asent: They were supposed to be the remains of a preserved lobsters claw containing some proto-clockwork; an eroded mechanism like some tiny sextant; a hand ful of nails and screws.\n","Processing asent: We searched the ground in that fringe zone.\n","Processing asent: We found potholes, cold scuffs, and the near-wintry remains of flowers, but no shallow-buried priceless treasures of the Precursor Age.\n","Processing asent: They had been picked up, long ago.\n","Processing asent: No one could sell them.\n","Processing asent: That makes it breach then, I said.\n","Processing asent: Wherever these Orciny-ites came from or went, they cant have picked the stuff up in Ul Qoma, so it was in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Well, maybe to them they never left Orciny.\n","Processing asent: But to most people they were put down in Ul Qoma and picked up in Besel, so its breach.\n","Processing asent: ASHIL CALLED THROUGH TO SOMEONEon our way back, and when we arrived at the quarters Breach were bickering and voting in their fast loose way on issues alien to me.\n","Processing asent: They entered the room in the middle of the strange debate, made cell phone calls, interrupted at speed.\n","Processing asent: The atmosphere was fraught, in that distinct expressionless Breach way.\n","Processing asent: There were reports from the two cities, with muttered additionsfrom those holding telephone receivers, delivering messages from other Breach.\n","Processing asent: Everyone on guard, Ashil kept saying.\n","Processing asent: This is starting.\n","Processing asent: They were afraid of head shots and breach mugging-murders.\n","Processing asent: The number of small breaches was increasing.\n","Processing asent: Breach were where they could be, but there were many they missed.\n","Processing asent: Someone said graffiti were appearing on walls in Ul Qoma in styles that suggested Besel artists.\n","Processing asent: It hasnt been this bad, since, well Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: He whispered explanations to me as the discussion continued.\n","Processing asent: Thats Raina.\n","Processing asent: Shes unremitting on this.\n","Processing asent: Samun thinks even mentioning Orcinys to give ground.\n","Processing asent: Byon doesnt.\n","Processing asent: We need to be ready, the speaker said.\n","Processing asent: We stumbled on something.\n","Processing asent: She did, Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: Not us, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Alright, she did.\n","Processing asent: Who knows when whatevers going to happen will?\n","Processing asent: Were in the dark and we know wars come, but cant see where to aim.\n","Processing asent: I cant deal with this, I said to Ashil quietly.\n","Processing asent: He escorted me back to the room.\n","Processing asent: When I realised he was locking me in I shouted in remonstration.\n","Processing asent: You need to remember why youre here, he said through the door.\n","Processing asent: I sat on the bed and tried to read Mahalias notes a new way.\n","Processing asent: I did not try to follow the thread of a particular pen, the tenor of a particular period of her studies, to reconstruct a lineage of thought.\n","Processing asent: Instead I read all the annotations on each page, years of opinions set together.\n","Processing asent: I had been trying to be an archaeologist of her marginalia, separating the striae.\n","Processing asent: Now I read each page out of time, no chronology, arguing with itself.\n","Processing asent: On the inside of the back cover among layers of irate theory I

shouted.\n","Processing asent: I did not know where the camera was.\n","Processing asent: Hey, Ashil.\n","Processing asent: Get Ashil.\n","Processing asent: I did not stop making noise until he arrived.\n","Processing asent: I need to get online.\n","Processing asent: He took me to a computer room, to what looked like a 486 or something similarly antique, with an operating system I did not recognise, some jury-rigged imitation of Windows, but the processor and connection were very fast.\n","Processing asent: We were two of several in the office.\n","Processing asent: Ashil stood behind me as I typed.\n","Processing asent: He watched my researches, as well, certainly, as ensuring I did not email anyone.\n","Processing asent: Go wherever you need, Ashil told me, and he was

took minutes.\n","Processing asent: I sat back.\n","Processing asent: Look.Look .\n","Processing asent: Sherman, Rosen, Vijnic are all absolute hate figures on these fractured-city boards, I said.\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: Because they wrote books claiming Bowden was full of shit.\n","Processing asent: That the whole arguments bollocks.\n","Processing asent: So does

about.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia was killed because shestopped believing in Orciny at all.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Six\n","Processing asent: THOUGH I BEGGEDand grew angry, Ashil and

here.\n","Processing asent: Dont forget.\n","Processing asent: You dont get to demand things.\n","Processing asent: Everything were doing is an investigation intoyour breach.\n","Processing asent: Do you understand?\n","Processing asent: They would not give me a computer in the cell.\n","Processing asent: I watched the sun rising, the air beyond my window growing light.\n","Processing asent: I had not realised how late it was.\n","Processing asent: I fell asleep at last, and woke with Ashil back in the room with me.\n","Processing asent: He drank somethingit was the first time Ihad seen him eat or drink anything.\n","Processing asent: I rubbed my eyes.\n","Processing asent: It was morning enough to be day.\n","Processing asent: Ashil did not seem an iota tired.\n","Processing asent: He tossed papers onto my lap, indicated a coffee and a pill by my bed.\n","Processing asent: Wasnt as hard as that, he said.\n","Processing asent: They sign off when they put the keys back, so we got all the dates.\n","Processing asent: Youve got the original schedules there, that changed, and the signings sheets themselves.\n","Processing asent: But there are loads.\n","Processing asent: We cant put a bead on Yorjavic let alone Syedr or any other nat for this many nights.\n","Processing asent: This stretches over more than two years.\n","Processing asent: Hold on.\n","Processing asent: I held the two lists against each other.\n","Processing asent: Forget when she was scheduled in advanceshe was obeying orders, dont forget, from her mysterious contact.\n","Processing asent: When shewasnt down

whoevers turn it is Ill do it.\n","Processing asent: These are the days she got a message.\n","Processing asent: She got told to deliver.\n","Processing asent: So lets see who was doing whatthen .\n","Processing asent: Those are the dates.\n","Processing asent: And there arent nearly so many.\n","Processing asent: Ashil noddedcounted the evenings in question.\n","Processing asent: Four, five.\n","Processing asent: Three pieces are missing.\n","Processing asent: So a couple of those days nothing happened.\n","Processing asent: Maybe they were legitimate changes, no instructions at all.\n","Processing asent: Theyre still the ones to chase.\n","Processing asent: Ashil nodded again.\n","Processing asent: Thats when were going to see the nats moving.\n","Processing asent: How did they organise this?\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: I dont know.\n","Processing asent: Wait here.\n","Processing asent: This would be easier if youd just let me come with you.\n","Processing asent: Why are you shy now?\n","Processing asent: More waiting, and though I did not shout at the unseen camera, I glared at all the walls in turn, so it would see me.\n","Processing asent: Ashils voice came from a loudspeaker I could not see.\n","Processing asent: Yorjavic was underpoliczai observation at least two of those nights.\n","Processing asent: He didnt go near the park.\n","Processing asent: What about Syedr?\n","Processing asent: I addressed the emptiness.\n","Processing asent: Accounted for on four of the nights.\n","Processing asent: Could be another of the nat bigwigs, but weve seen what Besel has on them all, and theres nothing red-flagging.\n","Processing asent: Shit.\n","Processing asent: What do you mean Syedrs accounted for?\n","Processing asent: We know where he was, and he was nowhere near.\n","Processing asent: He was in meetings those evenings and the days after them.\n","Processing asent: Meetings with whom?\n","Processing asent: Hes on the Chamber of Commerce.\n","Processing asent: They had trade events those days.\n","Processing asent: Silence.\n","Processing asent: When I did not speak a long time he said, What?\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: Weve been thinking wrong.\n","Processing asent: I pincered my fingers in the air, trying to catch something.\n","Processing asent: Just because it was Yorjavic who shot, and because we know Mahalia pissed off the nats.\n","Processing asent: But doesnt it seem like a hell of a coincidence that those trade things would happen on the very nights that Mahalia volunteers to lock up?\n","Processing asent: Another long quiet.\n","Processing asent: I remembered the delay before I could see the Oversight Committee, for one of those events.\n","Processing asent: There are receptions afterwards, for the guests, arent there?\n","Processing asent: The companies.\n","Processing asent: The ones Besels schmoozingthats what those things are for, when they bicker for contracts.\n","Processing asent: Ashil, find out who was there on those dates.\n","Processing asent: At the Chamber of Commerce\n","Processing asent: Check the guest lists for the parties afterwards.\n","Processing asent: Check press releases a few days afterwards and youll see who got what contract.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Jesus fucking Christ, I said minutes later in silence, when I still stalked back and forth in my room without him.\n","Processing asent: Why the fuck dont you just let me out?\n","Processing asent: Impoliczai , god damn it, this is what I do.\n","Processing asent: Youre good at being bogeymen but youre shit at this.\n","Processing asent: Youre a breacher, Ashil said, pushing open the door.\n","Processing asent: Its you were investigating.\n","Processing asent: Right.\n","Processing asent: Did you wait outside till I said something you could make an entrance to?\n","Processing asent: This is the list.\n","Processing asent: I took the paper.\n","Processing asent: CompaniesCanadian, French, Italian and British, a couple ofsmaller American onesnext to the various dates.\n","Processing asent: Five names were ringed in red.\n","Processing asent: The rest were there on one or other fair, but the ones in red, those ones are the ones that were there on every one of the nights Mahalia did the keys, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: ReddiTeks software.\n","Processing asent: Burnleywhat do they do?\n","Processing asent: Consultancy.\n","Processing asent: CorIntech are electronics components.\n","Processing asent: Whats this written next to them?\n","Processing asent: Ashil looked.\n","Processing asent: The man heading their delegation was Gorse, from their parent company, Sear and Core.\n","Processing asent: Came to meet up with the local head of CorIntech, guy runs the division in Besel.\n","Processing asent: They both went to the parties with Nyisemu and Buric and the rest of the chamber.\n","Processing asent: Shit, I said.\n","Processing asent: We Which time was he here?\n","Processing asent: All of them.\n","Processing asent: All?\n","Processing asent: TheCEO of the parent company?\n","Processing asent: Sear and Core?\n","Processing asent: Shit\n","Processing asent: Tell me, he said, eventually.\n","Processing asent: The nats couldnt pull this off.\n","Processing asent: Wait.\n","Processing asent: I thought.\n","Processing asent: We know theres an insider in Copula Hall but what the hell could Syedr do for these guys?\n","Processing asent: Corwis righthes a clown.\n","Processing asent: And what would be his angle?\n","Processing asent: I shook my head.\n","Processing asent: Ashil, how does this work?\n","Processing asent: You can just siphon this information, right, from either city.\n","Processing asent: Can you Whats your status internationally?\n","Processing asent: Breach, I mean.\n","Processing asent: We need to go for the company.\n","Processing asent: IM AN AVATAR OF BREACH, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Where breach has occurred I can do whatever.\n","Processing asent: But he made me run through it a long time.\n","Processing asent: His manner ossified, that opacity, the glimmerlessness of any sense of what he thoughtit was hard to tell if he even heard me.\n","Processing asent: He did not argue nor agree.\n","Processing asent: He stood, while I told him what I claimed.\n","Processing asent: No, they cant sell it, I said, thats not what this is about.\n","Processing asent: We had all heard rumours about Precursor artefacts.\n","Processing asent: Their questionable physics.\n","Processing asent: Their properties.\n","Processing asent: They want to see whats true.\n","Processing asent: Theyve gotMahalia to supply them.\n","Processing asent: And to do it theyve got her thinking shes in touch with Orciny.\n","Processing asent: But she realised.\n","Processing asent: Corwi had said something once about the visitors tours of Besel those companies representatives endured.\n","Processing asent: Their chauffeurs might take them anywhere total or crosshatched, any pretty park to stretch their legs.\n","Processing asent: Sear and Core had been doing R&D.\n","Processing asent: Ashil stared at me.\n","Processing asent: This doesnt make sense, he said.\n","Processing asent: Whod put money into superstitious nonsense ?\n","Processing asent: How sure are you?\n","Processing asent: That theres nothing to the stories?\n","Processing asent: And even if youre right, the CIA paid millions of dollars to men trying to kill goats by staring at them, I said.\n","Processing asent: Sear and Core pay, what, a few thousand dollars to set this up?\n","Processing asent: They dont have to believe a word of it: its worth that kind of money just on theoff chance that any of the stories turn out to have anything at all to them.\n","Processing asent: Its worth that for curiosity.\n","Processing asent: Ashil took out his cell and began to make calls.\n","Processing asent: It was the early part of the night.\n","Processing asent: We need a conclave, he said.\n","Processing asent: Big stake.\n","Processing asent: Yes, make it.\n","Processing asent: Conclave.\n","Processing asent: At the set.\n","Processing asent: He said more or less the same many times.\n","Processing asent: You can do anything, I said.\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Yes We need a show.\n","Processing asent: Breach in strength.\n","Processing asent: So you believe me?\n","Processing asent: Ashil, you do?\n","Processing asent: How would they do it?\n","Processing asent: How would outsiders like that get word to her?\n","Processing asent: I dont know, but thats what we have to find out.\n","Processing asent: Paid off a couple of localswe know where that money came to Yorj from.\n","Processing asent: They had been small amounts.\n","Processing asent: They could not possibly, not possibly create Orciny for her.\n","Processing asent: They wouldnt have theCEO of their parent here for these piddling little glad-handers, let alone every time Mahalia locks up.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Besels a basket case, and theyve already thrown us a bone by being here.\n","Processing asent: Theres got to be a connection\n","Processing asent: Oh, well investigate.\n","Processing asent: But these arent citizens nor citizens, Tye.\n","Processing asent: They dont have the A silence.\n","Processing asent: The fear, I said.\n","Processing asent: That Breach freeze, that obedience reflex shared in Ul Qoma and Besel.\n","Processing asent: They dont have a certain response to us, so if we do anything we need to show weightwe need many of us, a presence.\n","Processing asent: And if theres truth to this, its the shutdown of a major business in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Itll be a crisis for the city.\n","Processing asent: A catastrophe.\n","Processing asent: And no one will like that.\n","Processing asent: It isnt unknown for a city or a city to argue with Breach, Tye.\n","Processing asent: Its happened.\n","Processing asent: Thereve beenwars with Breach.\n","Processing asent: He waited while that image hung.\n","Processing asent: That doesnt help anyone.\n","Processing asent: So we need to have presence.\n","Processing asent: Breach needed to intimidate.\n","Processing asent: I understood.\n","Processing asent: Come on, I said.\n","Processing asent: Hurry.\n","Processing asent: But the ingathering of Breach avatars from wherever they had posted themselves, the attempt with that diffuse authority, a corralling of chaos, was not efficient.\n","Processing asent: Breach answered their phones, agreed, disagreed, said they would come or said they would not, said they would hear Ashil out.\n","Processing asent: This was to judge from his side of the conversations.\n","Processing asent: How many do you need?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: What are you waiting for?\n","Processing asent: We need apresence , I said.\n","Processing asent: You feel whats going on out there?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Youve felt it in the air.\n","Processing asent: There had been more than two hours of this.\n","Processing asent: I was wired by something in the food and drink I had been given, pacing and complaining of my incarceration.\n","Processing asent: More calls began to come in to Ashil.\n","Processing asent: More than the messages he had leftword had gone viral.\n","Processing asent: In the corridor was commotion, quick steps, voices, shouting and responding to shouts.\n","Processing asent: What is it?\n","Processing asent: Ashil was listening on his phone, not to the sound outside.\n","Processing asent: No, he said.\n","Processing asent: His voice betrayed nothing.\n","Processing asent: He said it again several times until he closed the phone and looked at me.\n","Processing asent: For the first time that set face looked like an evasion.\n","Processing asent: He did not know how to say what he had to say.\n","Processing asent: Whats happened?\n","Processing asent: The shouting outside was greater, and now there was noise from the street too.\n","Processing asent: A car crash?\n","Processing asent: Buses.\n","Processing asent: Two buses.\n","Processing asent: They breached?\n","Processing asent: He nodded.\n","Processing asent: Theyre in Besel.\n","Processing asent: They jackknifed on Finn Square.\n","Processing asent: A big crosshatched piazza.\n","Processing asent: Skidded into a wall in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: I did not say anything.\n","Processing asent: Any accident leading to breach obviously necessitated Breach, a few avatars gusting into view, sealing off the scene, sorting out parameters, ushering out the blameless, holding any breachers, handing authority back as quickly as possible to the police in the two cities.\n","Processing asent: There was nothing in the fact of a traffic breach to lead to the noise I heard outside, so there must be more.\n","Processing asent: They were buses taking refugees to camps.\n","Processing asent: Theyre out, and they havent been trained; theyre breaching everywhere, wandering between the cities without any idea what theyre doing.\n","Processing asent: I could imagine the panic of bystanders and passersby, let alone those innocent motorists of Besel and Ul Qoma, having swerved desperately out of the path of the careening vehicles, of necessity in and out of the topolganger city, trying hard to regain control and pull their vehicles back to where they dwelt.\n","Processing asent: Faced then with scores of afraid, injured intruders, without intent to transgress but without choice, without language to ask for help, stumbling out of the ruined buses, weeping children in their arms and bleeding across borders.\n","Processing asent: Approaching people they saw, not attuned to the nuances of nationalityclothes, colours, hair, postureoscillating back and forth between countries.\n","Processing asent: Weve called a closure, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Complete lockdown.\n","Processing asent: Clearing both the streets.\n","Processing asent: Breach is out in force, everywhere, until this is finished.\n","Processing asent: Martial Breach.\n","Processing asent: It had not happened in my lifetime.\n","Processing asent: No entrance to either city, no passage between them, ultrahard enforcement of all Breach rules.\n","Processing asent: The police of each city on mopping-up standby under Breach injunctions, adjuncts for the duration to the shutdown of borders.\n","Processing asent: That was the sound I could hear, those mechanised voices over the growing roar of sirens: loudspeakers announcing the closure in both languages.Get off the streets .\n","Processing asent: For a bus crash ?\n","Processing asent: It wasdeliberate, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: It was ambushed.\n","Processing asent: By unificationists.\n","Processing asent: Its happened.\n","Processing asent: Theyre all over.\n","Processing asent: Theres reports of breaches everywhere.\n","Processing asent: He was regaining himself.\n","Processing asent: Unifs in which city ?\n","Processing asent: I said, and my question petered out as I guessed the answer.\n","Processing asent: Both.\n","Processing asent: Theyre working in concert.\n","Processing asent: We dont even know if it was Bes unifs who stopped the buses.\n","Processing asent: Of course they worked together; that we knew.\n","Processing asent: But that those little bands of eager utopians could do this?\n","Processing asent: Could untether this breakdown, could make this happen?\n","Processing asent: Theyre everywhere in both cities.\n","Processing asent: This is their insurrection.\n","Processing asent: Theyre trying to merge us.\n","Processing asent: ASHIL WAS HESITATING.\n","Processing asent: That kept me talking, only that, that he was there in the room minutes more than he needed to be.\n","Processing asent: He was checking the contents of his pockets, preparing himself into soldierly alertness.\n","Processing asent: All Breach were called out.\n","Processing asent: He was expected.\n","Processing asent: The sirens continued, the voices continued.\n","Processing asent: Ashil, for Christs sake listen to me.\n","Processing asent: Listen to me.\n","Processing asent: You think this is coincidence?\n","Processing asent: Comeon .\n","Processing asent: Ashil, dont open that door.\n","Processing asent: You think we get to this, you think we figurethis out, get this far and all of a sudden theres a fucking uprising?\n","Processing asent: Someones doing this, Ashil.\n","Processing asent: To get you and all the Breach out and away from them.\n","Processing asent: How did you find out about which companies were here when?\n","Processing asent: The nights Mahalia delivered.\n","Processing asent: He was motionless.\n","Processing asent: Were Breach, he said eventually.\n","Processing asent: We can do whatever we need\n","Processing asent: Damn it, Ashil.\n","Processing asent: Im not some breacher for you to scare; I need to know.\n","Processing asent: How do you investigate?\n","Processing asent: At last: Taps.\n","Processing asent: Informants.\n","Processing asent: Glance up at the window, at a welling-up of the crisis sound.\n","Processing asent: He waited by the door for more from me.\n","Processing asent: Agents or systems in offices in Besel and Ul Qoma tell you what you need to know, right?\n","Processing asent: So someone somewhere was going through databases trying to find out who was where, when, in the Bes Chamber of Commerce.\n","Processing asent: Its been red-flagged, Ashil.\n","Processing asent: You sent someone looking, and them pulling up files has beenseen .\n","Processing asent: What better evidence do you need that were onto something?\n","Processing asent: Youve seen the unifs.\n","Processing asent: Theyre nothing.\n","Processing asent: Besel and Ul Qoma, doesnt make a difference, theyre a tiny bunch of dewy-eyed punks.\n","Processing asent: Theres more agents than agitators; someones given an order.\n","Processing asent: Someones engineered this because theyve realised were onto them.\n","Processing asent: Wait, I said.\n","Processing asent: The lockdown Its not just Copula Hall, right?\n","Processing asent: All borders to everywhere are closed, and no flights in or out, right?\n","Processing asent: BesAir and Illitania are grounded.\n","Processing asent: The airports arent taking incoming traffic.\n","Processing asent: What about private flights?\n","Processing asent: The instructions the same, but theyre not under our authority like the national carriers, so its a bit more\n","Processing asent: Thats what this is.\n","Processing asent: You cant lock them down, not in time.\n","Processing asent: Someones getting out.\n","Processing asent: We have to get to the Sear and Core building.\n","Processing asent: Thats where\n","Processing asent: Thats where whats happenings happening.\n","Processing asent: This I pointed at the window.\n","Processing asent: We heard the shattering of glass, the shouts, the frenetics of vehicles in panicked rush, the fight sounds.\n","Processing asent: This is a decoy.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Seven\n","Processing asent: IN THE STREETSwe went through the last throes, the nerve twitches of a little revolution that had died before it was born, and had not known it.\n","Processing asent: Those dying flails remained dangerous, though, and we were in a soldierly way.\n","Processing asent: No curfew could contain this panic.\n","Processing asent: People were running, in both cities, along the street in front of us while the barks of public announcements in Bes and Illitan warned them this was a Breach lockdown.\n","Processing asent: Windows broke.\n","Processing asent: Some figures I saw run did so with more giddiness than terror.\n","Processing asent: Not unifs, too small and too aimless: teenagers throwing stones, in their most transgressive act ever, little hurled breaches breaking glass in the city they did not live or stand in.\n","Processing asent: An Ul Qoman fire crew sped in its bleating engine the length of the road, towards where the night sky glowed.\n","Processing asent: A Bes wagon followed seconds behind it: they were still trying to maintain their distinctions, one fighting the fire in one part of the conjoined facade, the other in the other.\n","Processing asent: Those kids had better get out of the street fast, because Breach were everywhere.\n","Processing asent: Unseen by most still out that night, maintaining their covert methods.\n","Processing asent: Running I saw other Breach moving in what could pass as the urban panic of citizens of Besel and Ul Qoma but was a somewhat different motion, a more purposeful, predatory motion like Ashils and mine.\n","Processing asent: I could see them because of recent practice, as they could see me.\n","Processing asent: We saw a unif gang.\n","Processing asent: It was shocking to me even then after days of interstitial life to see them running together, from both chapters, in clothes which despite their transnational punk-and-rocker jackets and patches clearly marked them, to those attuned to urban semiosis, as from, whatever their desire,either Beselor Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Now they were grouped as one, dragging a grassroots breach with them as they went from wall to wall spraying slogans in a rather artful combine of Bes and Illitan, words that, perfectly legible if somewhat filigreed and seriffed, readTOGETHER!\n","Processing asent: UNITY! in both languages.\n","Processing asent: Ashil reached.\n","Processing asent: He carried a weapon he had prepared before we left.\n","Processing asent: I had not seen it closely.\n","Processing asent: We dont have time I started to say, but from the shadows around that insurgence a small group of figures did not so much emerge as come into focus.\n","Processing asent: Breach.\n","Processing asent: How do you move like that?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: The avatars were outnumbered, but they moved without fear into that group, where with sudden not dramatic but very brutal locks and throws they incapacitated three of the gang.\n","Processing asent: Some of the others rallied, and the Breach raised weapons.\n","Processing asent: I did not hear anything but two unifs dropped.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, I said, but we were moving.\n","Processing asent: With a key and a quick expert twist Ashil opened a random parked car, selected by unclear criteria.\n","Processing asent: Get in.\n","Processing asent: He glanced back.\n","Processing asent: Cessations best done out of sight; theyll move them.\n","Processing asent: This is an emergency.\n","Processing asent: Both cities are Breach now.\n","Processing asent: Only where it cant be avoided.\n","Processing asent: Only to secure the cities and the Breach.\n","Processing asent: What about the refugees?\n","Processing asent: There are other possibilities.\n","Processing asent: He started the engine.\n","Processing asent: There were few cars on the streets.\n","Processing asent: The trouble always seemed to be around corners from us.\n","Processing asent: Small groups of Breach were moving.\n","Processing asent: Several times someone, Breach, appeared in the chaos and seemed about to stop us; but each time Ashil stared or slapped his sigil or drummed in some secret fingercode, and his status as avatar was noted and we were away.\n","Processing asent: I had begged for more Breach to come with us.\n","Processing asent: They wont, he had said.\n","Processing asent: They wont believe.\n","Processing asent: I should be with them.\n","Processing asent: What do you mean?\n","Processing asent: Everyones dealing with this.\n","Processing asent: I dont have time to win the argument.\n","Processing asent: He said this, and it had been abruptly clear how few Breach there were.\n","Processing asent: How thin a line.\n","Processing asent: The crude democracy of their methodology, their decentralised self-ordering, meant that Ashil could do this mission the importance of which I had convinced him, but the crisis meant we were alone.\n","Processing asent: Ashil took us across lanes of highway, through straining borders, avoiding little anarchies.Militsya andpoliczai were on corners.\n","Processing asent: Sometimes Breach would emerge from the night with that uncanny motion they perfected and order the local police to do somethingto take some unif or body away, to guard somethingthen disappear again.\n","Processing asent: Twice I saw them escorting terrified north African men and women from somewhere to somewhere, refugees made the levers of this breakdown.\n","Processing asent: It isnt possible, this, weve Ashil interrupted himself, touched his earpiece as reports came in.\n","Processing asent: There would be camps full of unificationists after this.\n","Processing asent: We were in a moment of outright foregone conclusion, but the unifs still fought to mobilise populations deeply averse to their mission.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps the memory of this joint action would buoy up whichever of them remained after that night.\n","Processing asent: It must be an intoxication to step through the borders and greet their foreign comrades across what they made suddenly one street, to make their own country even if just for seconds at night in front of a scrawled slogan and a broken window.\n","Processing asent: They must know by now that the populaces were not coming with them, but they did not disappear back to their respective cities.\n","Processing asent: How could they go back now?\n","Processing asent: Honour, despair, or bravery kept them coming.\n","Processing asent: It isnt possible, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: There is no way the head of Sear and Core, someoutsider , could have constructed this Weve He listened, set his face.\n","Processing asent: Weve lost avatars.\n","Processing asent: What a war, this now bloody war between those dedicated to bringing the cities together and the force charged with keeping them apart.\n","Processing asent: UNITY had been half written across the face of the Ungir Hallwhich was also the Sul Kibai Palace, so now in dripping paint the building said something nonsense.\n","Processing asent: What passed as Besels business districts were nowhere near the Ul Qoman equivalent.\n","Processing asent: The headquarters of Sear and Core were on the banks of the Colinin, one of the few successes in the attempts to revivify Besels dying dockside.\n","Processing asent: We passed the dark water.\n","Processing asent: We both looked up at percussion in the otherwise empty locked-down sky.\n","Processing asent: A helicopter the only thing in the air, backlit by its own powerful lights as it left us below.\n","Processing asent: Its them, I said.\n","Processing asent: Were too late.\n","Processing asent: But the copter was coming in from the west, towards the riverbank.\n","Processing asent: It was not an exit; it was a pickup.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: Even in such a distracting night Ashils driving prowess cowed me.\n","Processing asent: He veered across the dark bridge, took a one-way total street in Besel the wrong way, startling pedestrians trying to get out of the night, through a crosshatch plaza then a total Ul Qoma street.\n","Processing asent: I was leaning to watch the helicopter descend into the roofscape by the river, half a mile ahead of us.\n","Processing asent: Its down, I said.\n","Processing asent: Move.\n","Processing asent: There was the reconfigured warehouse, the inflatable gasrooms of Ul Qoman buildings to either side of it.\n","Processing asent: No one was in the square, but there were lights on throughout the Sear and Core building, despite the hour, and there were guards in the entrance.\n","Processing asent: They came towards us aggressively when we entered.\n","Processing asent: Marbled and fluorescently lit, the S&C logo in stainless steel and placed as if it were art on the walls, magazines and corporate reports made to look like magazines on tables by sofas.\n","Processing asent: Get the fuck out, a man said.\n","Processing asent: Bes ex-military.\n","Processing asent: He put his hand to his holster and led his men towards us.\n","Processing asent: He came up short a moment later: he saw how Ashil moved.\n","Processing asent: Stand down, Ashil said, glowering to intimidate.\n","Processing asent: The whole of Besels in Breach tonight.\n","Processing asent: He did not have to show his sigil.\n","Processing asent: The men fell back.\n","Processing asent: Unlock the lift now, give me the keys to reach the helipad, and stand down.\n","Processing asent: No one else comes in.\n","Processing asent: If the security had been foreign, had come from Sear and Cores home country, or been drafted in from its European or North Americanoperations, they might not have obeyed.\n","Processing asent: But this was Besel and the security was Bes, and they did as Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: In the elevator, he drew out his weapon.\n","Processing asent: A big pistol of unfamiliar design.\n","Processing asent: Its barrel encased, muzzled in some dramatic silencer.\n","Processing asent: He worked the key the security had given us, to the corporate levels, all the way up.\n","Processing asent: THE DOOR OPENEDonto gusts of hard cold air amid surrounds of vaulting roofs and antennae.\n","Processing asent: The tethers of the Ul Qoman gasrooms, a few streets off the mirrored fronts of Ul Qoman businesses, the spires of temples in both cities, and there in the darkness and the wind ahead of us behind a thicket of safety rails the helipad.\n","Processing asent: The dark vehicle waiting, its rotor turning very slowly, almost without noise.\n","Processing asent: Gathered before it a group of men.\n","Processing asent: We could not hear much except the bass of the engine, the siren-infested putting down of unification riots all around us.\n","Processing asent: The men by the helicopter did not hear us as we approached.\n","Processing asent: We stayed close to cover.\n","Processing asent: Ashil led me towards the aircraft, the gang who did not yet see us.\n","Processing asent: There were four of them.\n","Processing asent: Two were large and shaven-headed.\n","Processing asent: They looked like ultranats: True Citizens on secret commission.\n","Processing asent: They stood around a suited man I did not know and someone I could not see from the way he stood, in deep and animated conversation.\n","Processing asent: I heard nothing, but one of the men saw us.\n","Processing asent: There was a commotion and they turned.\n","Processing asent: From his cockpit the pilot of the helicopter swivelled the police-strength light he held.\n","Processing asent: Just before it framed us the gathered men moved and I could see the last man, staring straight at me.\n","Processing asent: It was Mikhel Buric.\n","Processing asent: The Social Democrat, the opposition, the other man on the Chamber of Commerce.\n","Processing asent: Blinded by the floodlight I felt Ashil grab me and pull me behind a thick iron ventilator pipe.\n","Processing asent: There was a moment of dragged-out quiet.\n","Processing asent: I waited for a shot but no one shot.\n","Processing asent: Buric, I said to Ashil.Buric .\n","Processing asent: I knew there was no way Syedr could do this.\n","Processing asent: Buric was the contact man, the organiser.\n","Processing asent: Who knew Mahaliaspredilections, who had seen her on her first visit to Besel, when she angered everyone at the conference with her undergraduate dissidence.\n","Processing asent: Buric the operator.\n","Processing asent: He knew her work and what she wanted, that abhistory, the comforts of paranoia, a cosseting by the man behind the curtain.\n","Processing asent: In the Chamber of Commerce as he was, he was in a position to provide it.\n","Processing asent: To find an outlet for what she stole at his behest, for the invented benefit of Orciny.\n","Processing asent: It was all geared stuff that got stolen, I said.\n","Processing asent: Sear and Core are investigating the artefacts.\n","Processing asent: This is a science experiment.\n","Processing asent: It was his informershe like all Bes politicians had themwho had told Buric that investigations had occurred into Sear and Core, that we were chasing down the truth.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps he thought we had understood more than we had, would be shocked at how little of this we could have predicted.\n","Processing asent: It would not take so much for a man in his position to order the government provocateurs in the poor foolish unificationists to begin their work, to forestall Breach so he and his collaborators could get away.\n","Processing asent: Theyre armed?\n","Processing asent: Ashil glanced out and nodded.\n","Processing asent: Mikhel Buric?\n","Processing asent: I shouted.Buric?\n","Processing asent: What are True Citizens doing with a liberal sellout like you?\n","Processing asent: You getting good soldiers like Yorj killed?\n","Processing asent: Bumping off students you think are getting too close to your bullshit?\n","Processing asent: Piss off, Borl, he said.\n","Processing asent: He did not sound angry.\n","Processing asent: Were all patriots.\n","Processing asent: They know my record.\n","Processing asent: A noise joined the noise of the night.\n","Processing asent: The helicopters engine, speeding up.\n","Processing asent: Ashil looked at me and stepped out into full view.\n","Processing asent: Mikhel Buric, he said, in his frightening voice.\n","Processing asent: He kept his gun unwavering and walked behind it, as if it led him, towards the helicopter.\n","Processing asent: Youre answerable to Breach.\n","Processing asent: Come with me. I followed him.\n","Processing asent: He glanced at the man beside Buric.\n","Processing asent: Ian Croft, regional head of CorIntech, Buric said to Ashil.\n","Processing asent: He folded his arms.\n","Processing asent: A guest here.\n","Processing asent: Address your remarks to me.\n","Processing asent: And fuck yourself.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens had their own pistols up.\n","Processing asent: Buric moved towards the helicopter.\n","Processing asent: Stay where you are, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: You will stepback, he shouted at the True Citizens.\n","Processing asent: I amBreach.\n","Processing asent: So what?\n","Processing asent: Buric said.\n","Processing asent: Ive spentyears running this place.\n","Processing asent: Ive kept the unifs in line, Ive been gettingbusiness for Besel , Ive been taking their damned gewgaws out fromunder Ul Qoman noses , and what do you do?\n","Processing asent: You gutless Breach?\n","Processing asent: You protect Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Ashil actually gaped a moment at that.\n","Processing asent: Hes playing to them, I whispered.\n","Processing asent: To the True Citizens.\n","Processing asent: Unifs have one thing right, Buric said.\n","Processing asent: Theres only one city, and if it werent for the superstition and cowardice of the populace, kept in place by you goddamnedBreach , wed all know there was only one city.\n","Processing asent: Andthat city is called Besel .\n","Processing asent: And youre telling patriots to obeyyou?\n","Processing asent: I warned them, Iwarned my comrades you might turn up, despite it being made clear you have no business here.\n","Processing asent: Thats why you leaked the footage of the van, I said.\n","Processing asent: To keep Breach out of it, send the mess to themilitsya instead.\n","Processing asent: Breachs priorities arenot Besels, Buric said.\n","Processing asent: Fuck the Breach.\n","Processing asent: He said it carefully.\n","Processing asent: Here we recognise only one authority, you pissing little neither-nor, and that isBesel.\n","Processing asent: He indicated Croft to precede him into the helicopter.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens stared.\n","Processing asent: They were not quite ready to fire on Ashil, to provoke Breach waryou could see a kind of blasphemy-drunkenness in their look at the intransigence they were already showing, disobeying Breach even this farbut they would not lower their guns either.\n","Processing asent: If he shot they would shoot back, and there were two of them.\n","Processing asent: High on their obedience to Buric they did not need to know anything about where their paymaster was going or why, only that he had charged them to cover his back while he did.\n","Processing asent: They were fired with jingo bravery.\n","Processing asent: Im not Breach, I said.\n","Processing asent: Buric turned to look at me.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens stared at me. I felt Ashils hesitation.\n","Processing asent: He kept his weapon up.\n","Processing asent: Im not Breach.\n","Processing asent: I breathed deep.\n","Processing asent: I am Inspector Tyador Borl.\n","Processing asent: Besel Extreme Crimes Squad.\n","Processing asent: Im not here for Breach, Buric.\n","Processing asent: I represent the Beselpoliczai , to enforce Bes law.\n","Processing asent: Because you broke it.\n","Processing asent: Smugglings not my department; take what you want.\n","Processing asent: Im not a political manI dont care if you mess with Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Im here because youre a murderer.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia wasnt Ul Qoman, nor an enemy of Besel, and if she seemed to be, it was only because she believed the crapyou told her, so you could sell what she supplied you, for thisforeigners R and D. Doing it for Besel, my arse: youre just a fence for foreign bucks.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens looked uneasy.\n","Processing asent: But she realised shed been lied to.\n","Processing asent: That she wasnt righting antique wrongs or learning any hidden truth.\n","Processing asent: That youd made her a thief.\n","Processing asent: You sent Yorjavic over to get rid of her.\n","Processing asent: That makes it an Ul Qoman crime, so even with the links we will find between you and him, nothing I can do.\n","Processing asent: But thats not the end of it.\n","Processing asent: When you heard Yolanda was hiding, you thought Mahaliad told her something.\n","Processing asent: Couldnt risk her talking.\n","Processing asent: You were smart to get Yorj to take her out from his side of the checkpoint, keep Breach off your backs.\n","Processing asent: But that makes his shot, and the order you gave for it, Bes.\n","Processing asent: And that makes you mine.\n","Processing asent: Minister Mikhel Buric, by the authority vested in me by the government and courts of the Commonwealth of Besel, you are under arrest for Conspiracy to Murder Yolanda Rodriguez.\n","Processing asent: You are coming with me.\n","Processing asent: SECOND AFTER SECONDof astonished silence.\n","Processing asent: I stepped slowly forward, past Ashil, towards Mikhel Buric.\n","Processing asent: It would not last.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens mostly had not much more respect for we who they believed were the weak local police than for many other of the herdlike masses of Besel.\n","Processing asent: But those were ugly charges, in Besels name, that did not sound like the politics for which they were signed up, or the reasons they might have been given for those killings, if they even knew about them.\n","Processing asent: The two men looked at each other uncertainly.\n","Processing asent: Ashil moved.\n","Processing asent: I breathed out.\n","Processing asent: Fuck damn, Buric said.\n","Processing asent: From his pocket he took his own small pistol and raised it and pointed it at me. I said, Oh, or something as I stumbled back.\n","Processing asent: I heard a shot but it did not sound as I expected.\n","Processing asent: Not explosive; it was a hard-breathed gust of breath, a rush.\n","Processing asent: I remember thinking that and being surprised that I would notice such a thing as I died.\n","Processing asent: Buric leapt into instant backward scarecrow motion, his limbscrazy and a rush of colour on his chest.\n","Processing asent: I had not been shot; he had been shot.\n","Processing asent: He threw his little weapon away as if deliberately.\n","Processing asent: It was the silenced blast of Ashils pistol I had heard.\n","Processing asent: Buric fell, his chest all blood.\n","Processing asent: Now, there,that was the sound of shots.\n","Processing asent: Two, quickly, a third.\n","Processing asent: Ashil fell.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens had fired on him.\n","Processing asent: Stop, stop, I screamed.\n","Processing asent: Hold your fucking fire!\n","Processing asent: I scrabbled crabwise back to him.\n","Processing asent: Ashil was sprawled across the concrete, bleeding.\n","Processing asent: He was growling in pain.\n","Processing asent: You two are under fucking arrest, I shouted.\n","Processing asent: The True Citizens stared at each other, at me, at the unmoving dead Buric.\n","Processing asent: This escort job had become suddenly violent and utterly confusing.\n","Processing asent: You could see them glimpse the scale of the web that snagged them.\n","Processing asent: One muttered to the other and they backed away, jogged towards the lift shaft.\n","Processing asent: Stay where you are, I shouted, but they ignored me as I knelt by wheezing Ashil.\n","Processing asent: Croft still stood motionless by the helicopter.\n","Processing asent: Dont you goddamn move, I said, but the True Citizens pulled open the door to the roof and disappeared back down into Besel.\n","Processing asent: Im alright, Im alright, Ashil gasped.\n","Processing asent: I patted him to find his injuries.\n","Processing asent: Below his clothes he was wearing some kind of armour.\n","Processing asent: It had stopped what would have been the killing bullet, but he had been also hit below his shoulder and was bleeding and in pain.\n","Processing asent: You, he managed to shout to Sear and Cores man.\n","Processing asent: Stay.\n","Processing asent: You may be protected in Besel but youre notin Besel if I say youre not.\n","Processing asent: Youre in Breach.\n","Processing asent: Croft leaned into the cockpit and said something to the pilot, who nodded and sped up the rotor.\n","Processing asent: Are you finished?\n","Processing asent: Croft said.\n","Processing asent: Get out.\n","Processing asent: That vehicles grounded.\n","Processing asent: Even through pain-gritted teeth and having dropped his pistol, Ashil made his demand.\n","Processing asent: Im neither Bes nor Ul Qoman, Croft said.\n","Processing asent: He spoke in English, though he clearly understood us.\n","Processing asent: Im neither interested in nor scared of you.\n","Processing asent: Im leaving.\n","Processing asent: Breach.\n","Processing asent: He shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Freak show.\n","Processing asent: You think anyone beyond these odd little cities cares about you?They may bankroll you and do what you say, ask no questions,they may need to be scared of you, but no one else does.\n","Processing asent: He sat next to the pilot and strapped himself in.\n","Processing asent: Not that I think you could, but I strongly suggest you and your colleagues dont try to stop this vehicle.\n","Processing asent: Grounded.\n","Processing asent: What do you think would happen if you provoked my government?\n","Processing asent: Its funny enough the idea of either Besel or Ul Qoma going to war against a real country.\n","Processing asent: Let alone you, Breach.\n","Processing asent: He closed the door.\n","Processing asent: We did not try to get up for a while, Ashil and I.\n","Processing asent: He lay there, me kneeling behind him, as the helicopter grew louder and the distended-looking thing eventually bobbed up as if dangled from string, pouring air down on us, ripping our clothes every way and buffeting Burics corpse.\n","Processing asent: It tore away between the low towers of the two cities, in the airspace of Besel and Ul Qoma, once again the only thing in the sky.\n","Processing asent: I watched it go.\n","Processing asent: An invasion of Breach.\n","Processing asent: Paratroopers landing in either city, storming the secret offices in their contested buildings.\n","Processing asent: To attack Breach an invader would have to breach Besel and Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Wounded avatar, Ashil said into his radio.\n","Processing asent: He gave our location.\n","Processing asent: Assist.\n","Processing asent: Coming, the machine said.\n","Processing asent: He sat back against the wall.\n","Processing asent: In the east the sky was beginning faintly to lighten.\n","Processing asent: There were still noises of violence from below, but fewer and ebbing.\n","Processing asent: There were more sirens, Bes and Ul Qoman, as thepoliczai andmilitsya reclaimed their own streets, as Breach withdrew where it could.\n","Processing asent: There would be a day more of lockdown to clear last nests of unifs, to return to normalcy, to corral the lost refugees back to the camps, but we were past the worst of it.\n","Processing asent: I watched the dawn-lit clouds begin.\n","Processing asent: I checked Burics body, but he carried nothing on him.\n","Processing asent: ASHIL SAID SOMETHING.\n","Processing asent: His voice was weak, and I had to have him repeat himself.\n","Processing asent: I still cant believe it, he said.\n","Processing asent: That he could have done this.\n","Processing asent: Buric.\n","Processing asent: Any of them.\n","Processing asent: I leaned against a chimney and watched him.\n","Processing asent: I watched the sun coming.\n","Processing asent: No, I said finally.\n","Processing asent: She was too smart.\n","Processing asent: Young but\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: She worked it out in the end, but you wouldnt think Buric could have taken her in to begin with.\n","Processing asent: And then the way it was done, I said slowly.\n","Processing asent: If he had someone killed we wouldnt find the body.\n","Processing asent: Buric was not competent enough at one end, too competent at the other, to make sense of this story.\n","Processing asent: I sat still in the slowly growing light as we waited for help.\n","Processing asent: She was a specialist, I said.\n","Processing asent: She knew all about the history.\n","Processing asent: Buric was clever, but not like that.\n","Processing asent: What are you thinking, Tye?\n","Processing asent: There were sounds from one of the doors that jutted onto the roof.\n","Processing asent: A slamming and it flew open, disgorging someone I vaguely recognised as Breach.\n","Processing asent: She came towards us, speaking into her radio.\n","Processing asent: How did they know where Yolanda would be?\n","Processing asent: Heard your plans, he said.\n","Processing asent: Listening to your friend Corwis phone He offered the idea.\n","Processing asent: Why did they shoot at Bowden?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Ashil looked at me.\n","Processing asent: At Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: We thought it was Orciny, going for him, because he inadvertently knew the truth.\n","Processing asent: But it wasnt Orciny.\n","Processing asent: It was I looked at dead Buric.\n","Processing asent: His orders.\n","Processing asent: So why would he go for Bowden?\n","Processing asent: Ashil nodded.\n","Processing asent: He spoke slowly.\n","Processing asent: They thought Mahalia told Yolanda what she knew, but\n","Processing asent: Ashil?\n","Processing asent: the approaching woman shouted, and Ashil nodded.\n","Processing asent: He even stood, but sat down again, heavily.\n","Processing asent: Ashil, I said.\n","Processing asent: Okay, okay, he said.\n","Processing asent: I just He closed his eyes.\n","Processing asent: The woman came faster.\n","Processing asent: He opened them suddenly and looked at me.\n","Processing asent: Bowden told you all along Orciny wasnt true.\n","Processing asent: Move, the woman said.\n","Processing asent: Ill get you out of here.\n","Processing asent: What are you going to do?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Come on Ashil, she said.\n","Processing asent: Youre weak\n","Processing asent: Yes I am.\n","Processing asent: He interrupted her himself.\n","Processing asent: But He coughed.\n","Processing asent: He stared at me and I at him.\n","Processing asent: We have to get him out, I said.\n","Processing asent: We have to get Breach to But they were still engaged in the end of that night, and there was no time to convince anyone.\n","Processing asent: A second, he said to the woman.\n","Processing asent: He took his sigil out of his pocket and gave it to me, along with a ring of keys.\n","Processing asent: I authorize it, he said.\n","Processing asent: She raised an eyebrow but did not argue.\n","Processing asent: I think my gun went over there.\n","Processing asent: The rest of Breach is still\n","Processing asent: Give me your phone.\n","Processing asent: Whats its number?\n","Processing asent: Now go.\n","Processing asent: Get him out of here.\n","Processing asent: Ashil, Ill do it.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Eight\n","Processing asent: THE BREACH WITH ASHILdid not ask me for help.\n","Processing asent: She shooed me away.\n","Processing asent: I found his weapon.\n","Processing asent: It was heavy, its silencer almost organic-looking, like something phlegmy coating the muzzle.\n","Processing asent: I had to look for far too long before I could find the safety catch.\n","Processing asent: I did not risk trying to release the clip to check it.\n","Processing asent: I pocketed it and took the stairs.\n","Processing asent: As I descended I scrolled through the numbers in the phones contacts list: they were meaningless-seeming strings of letters.\n","Processing asent: I hand-dialled the number I needed.\n","Processing asent: On a hunch I did not prefix a country code, and I was rightthe connection made.\n","Processing asent: When I reached the foyer it was ringing.\n","Processing asent: The security looked at me uncertainly, but I held out the Breach sigil and they backed away.\n","Processing asent: What who is this?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, its me.\n","Processing asent: Holy Light,Borl?\n","Processing asent: What where are you?\n","Processing asent: Whereve you been?\n","Processing asent: Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, shut up and listen.\n","Processing asent: I know its not morning yet, but I need you to wake up and I need you to help

asent: I need you to help me.\n","Processing asent: Wheres Bowden?\n","Processing asent: You lot took him in for questioning, right?\n","Processing asent: Bowden?\n","Processing asent: Yeah, but we didnt hold him.\n","Processing asent: Why?\n","Processing asent: Where is he?\n","Processing asent: Holy Light, Borl.\n","Processing asent: I could hear him sitting up, pulling himself together.\n","Processing asent: At his flat.\n","Processing asent: Dont panic; hes watched.\n","Processing asent: Send them in.\n","Processing asent: Hold him.\n","Processing asent: Till I get there.\n","Processing asent: Just do it, please.\n","Processing asent: Send them now.\n","Processing asent: Thanks.\n","Processing asent: Call me when you have him.\n","Processing asent: Wait, wait.\n","Processing asent: What number is this?\n","Processing asent: It isnt showing on my phone.\n","Processing asent: I told him.\n","Processing asent: In the square, I watched the lightening sky and the birds wheel over both cities.\n","Processing asent: I walked back and forth, one of few but not the only person out at that hour.\n","Processing asent: I watched the others who passed close, furtively.\n","Processing asent: I watched them trying to retreat to their home cityBesel, Ul Qoma, Besel, whicheverout of the massive Breach that was at last ebbing around them.\n","Processing asent: Borl.\n","Processing asent: Hes gone.\n","Processing asent: What do you mean?\n","Processing asent: There was a detail on his apartment, right?\n","Processing asent: For protection, after he got shot?\n","Processing asent: Well, when stuff started going mad tonight it was all hands to the pump and they got pulled off onto some other job.\n","Processing asent: I dont know the ins and outsno

but still, put a halo on him?\n","Processing asent: Send , not put.\n","Processing asent: Alright.\n","Processing asent: Were not going to find him, though.\n","Processing asent: There were more rescue vehicles on the roads, in both cities, racing to the sites of continued crisis, here and there civilian vehicles, ostentatiously obeying their own citys traffic laws, negotiating around each other with unusual legal care, like the few pedestrians.\n","Processing asent: They must have good and defensible reasons to be out.\n","Processing asent: The assiduousness of their unseeing and seeing was marked.\n","Processing asent: The crosshatching is resilient.\n","Processing asent: It was predawn cold.\n","Processing asent: With his skeleton key but without Ashils aplomb I was breaking

not fucking wrong because you know what?\n","Processing asent: It might be.\n","Processing asent: Tonight of all nights.\n","Processing asent: Breach are all over the place; there was just a fuckingclosure , Tyad.\n","Processing asent: The last thing anyones going to do is risk breaching.\n","Processing asent: Thats the last information youre going to get unless Bowden moves so they can tell hes definitely in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Where is he now?\n","Processing asent: How can I know?\n","Processing asent: They wont risk watching him.\n","Processing asent: All theyd say was that he started walking.\n","Processing asent: Just walking, but so no one can tell where he is.\n","Processing asent: No ones stopping him?\n","Processing asent: They dont even know if they cansee him.\n","Processing asent: But hes not breaching either.\n","Processing asent: They just cant tell.\n","Processing asent: Pause.\n","Processing asent: Tyad?\n","Processing asent: Jesus Christ, of course.\n","Processing asent: Hes beenwaiting for someone to notice him.\n","Processing asent: I sped the car towards Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: It was several miles away.\n","Processing asent: I swore.\n","Processing asent: What?\n","Processing asent: Tyad, what?\n","Processing asent: This is what he wants.\n","Processing asent: You said it yourself, Dhatt; hell be turned back from the border by the guard of whichever city hes in.\n","Processing asent: Which is?\n","Processing asent: There were seconds of silence.\n","Processing asent: Fuck me, Dhatt said.\n","Processing asent: In that uncertain state, no one would stop Bowden.\n","Processing asent: No one could.\n","Processing asent: Where are you?\n","Processing asent: How close are you to Copula Hall?\n","Processing asent: I can be there in ten minutes, but\n","Processing asent: But he would not stop Bowden either.\n","Processing asent: Agonised as Dhatt was, he would not risk Breach by seeing a man who might not be in his city.\n","Processing asent: I wanted to tell him not to be concerned, I wanted to beg him, but could I tell him he was wrong?\n","Processing asent: I did not know he would not be watched.\n","Processing asent: Could I say he was safe?\n","Processing asent: Would themilitsya arrest him on your say-so if he was definitely in Ul Qoma?\n","Processing asent: Sure, but they wont follow him if they cant risk seeing him.\n","Processing asent: Then you go.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, please.\n","Processing asent: Listen.\n","Processing asent: Nothings stopping you just going for a walk, right?\n","Processing asent: Just going out there to Copula Hall and going wherever you want, and if it happens that someone who happens to be always in your vicinity tips a hand and turns out to be in Ul Qoma, then you could arrest him, right?\n","Processing asent: No one had to admit a thing, even to themselves.\n","Processing asent: So long as there was no interaction while Bowden was unclear, there would be plausible deniability.\n","Processing asent: Please, Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: Alright.\n","Processing asent: But listen, if Im going for a fucking walk and someone in my maybe-grosstopic proximity doesnot turn out forcertain into Ul Qoma, then I cant arrest him.\n","Processing asent: Hold on.\n","Processing asent: Youre right.\n","Processing asent: I could not ask him to risk breaching.\n","Processing asent: And Bowden might have crossed and be Besel, in which case Dhatt was powerless.\n","Processing asent: Okay.\n","Processing asent: Go for your walk.\n","Processing asent: Let me know when youre at Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: I have to make another call.\n","Processing asent: I disconnected and dialled another number, also without an international code, though it was in another country.\n","Processing asent: Despite the hour the phone was answered almost immediately, and the voice that answered was alert.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, I said.\n","Processing asent: Boss?\n","Processing asent: Jesus,boss , whereare you?\n","Processing asent: Whats happening?\n","Processing asent: Are you okay?\n","Processing asent: Whats going on?\n","Processing asent: Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Ill tell you everything, but right now I cant; right now I need you to move, and move fast, and not ask any questions and to just do exactly as I say.\n","Processing asent: I need you to go to Copula Hall.\n","Processing asent: I CHECKED MY WATCHand glanced at the sky, which seemed resistant to morning.\n","Processing asent: In their respective cities Dhatt and Corwi were on their way to the border.\n","Processing asent: It was Dhatt who called me first.\n","Processing asent: Im here, Borl.\n","Processing asent: Can you see him?\n","Processing asent: Have you found him?\n","Processing asent: Where is he?\n","Processing asent: Silence.\n","Processing asent: Alright, Dhatt, listen.\n","Processing asent: He would not see what he was not sure wasin Ul Qoma, but he would not have called me had there been no point to the contact.\n","Processing asent: Where are you?\n","Processing asent: Im at the corner of Illya and Suhash.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, I wish I knew how to do conference calls on this thing.\n","Processing asent: Ive got call waiting figured, so stay on the damn phone.\n","Processing asent: I connected to Corwi.\n","Processing asent: Corwi?\n","Processing asent: Listen.\n","Processing asent: I had to pull up by the kerb and compare the map of Ul Qoma in the cars glove compartment with my knowledge of Besel.\n","Processing asent: Most of the Old Towns were crosshatched.\n","Processing asent: Corwi, I need you to go to ByulaStrsz and and WarszaStrsz.\n","Processing asent: Youve seen the photos of Bowden, right?\n","Processing asent: I know, I know.\n","Processing asent: I drove.\n","Processing asent: If youre not sure hes in Besel you wont touch him.\n","Processing asent: Like I said, Im just asking you to go walking so that if anyonewere to turn out to be in Besel, you could arrest him.\n","Processing asent: And tell me where you are.\n","Processing asent: Okay?\n","Processing asent: Careful.\n","Processing asent: Of what, boss?\n","Processing asent: It was a point.\n","Processing asent: Bowden would not likely attack either Dhatt or Corwi: do so and he would declare himself a criminal, in Besel or Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Attack both and he would be in Breach, which, unbelievably, he was not yet.\n","Processing asent: He walked with equipoise, possibly in either city.\n","Processing asent: Schrdingers pedestrian.\n","Processing asent: Where are you, Dhatt?\n","Processing asent: Halfway up Teipei Street.\n","Processing asent: Teipei shared its space grosstopically with MirandiStrsz in Besel.\n","Processing asent: I told Corwi where to go.\n","Processing asent: I wont be long.\n","Processing asent: I was over the river now, and the number of vehicles on the street was increasing.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt, where is he?\n","Processing asent: Where are you, I mean?\n","Processing asent: He told me.\n","Processing asent: Bowden had to stick to crosshatched streets.\n","Processing asent: If he trod on a total area, hed be committing to that city, and its police could take him.\n","Processing asent: In the centres the most ancient streets were too narrow and twisted for the car to save me any time and I deserted it, running through the cobbles and overhanging eaves of Besel Old Town by the intricate mosaics and vaults of Ul Qoma Old Town.\n","Processing asent: Move!\n","Processing asent: I shouted at the few people in my way.\n","Processing asent: I held out the Breach sigil, the phone in my other hand.\n","Processing asent: Im at the end of MirandiStrsz, boss.\n","Processing asent: Corwis voice hadchanged.\n","Processing asent: She would not admit she could see Bowdenshe did not, nor quite did she unsee him, she was between the twobut she was no longer simply following my directions.\n","Processing asent: She was close to him.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps he could see her.\n","Processing asent: One more time I examined Ashils gun, but it made little sense to me. I could not work it.\n","Processing asent: I returned it to my pocket, went to where Corwi waited in Besel, Dhatt in Ul Qoma, and to where Bowden walked no one was quite sure where.\n","Processing asent: I SAW DHATT FIRST.\n","Processing asent: He was in his full uniform, his arm in a sling, his phone to his ear.\n","Processing asent: I tapped him on the shoulder as I passed him.\n","Processing asent: He started massively, saw it was me, and gasped.\n","Processing asent: He closed his phone slowly and indicated a direction with his eyes, for the briefest moment.\n","Processing asent: He stared at me with an expression I was not sure I recognised.\n","Processing asent: The glance was not necessary.\n","Processing asent: Though a small number of people were braving the overlapping crosshatched street, Bowden was instantly visible.\n","Processing asent: That gait.\n","Processing asent: Strange, impossible.\n","Processing asent: Not properly describ-able, but to anyone used to the physical vernaculars of Besel and Ul Qoma, it was rootless and untethered, purposeful and without a country.\n","Processing asent: I saw him from behind.\n","Processing asent: He did not drift but strode with pathological neutrality away from the cities centres, ultimately to borders and the mountains and out to the rest of the continent.\n","Processing asent: In front of him a few curious locals were seeing him then with clear uncertainty half looking away, unsure where, in fact, to look.\n","Processing asent: I pointed at them, each in turn, and made ago motion, and they went.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps some watched from their windows, but that was deniable.\n","Processing asent: I approached Bowden under the looming of Besel and the intricate coiled gutters of Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: A few metres from him, Corwi watched me.\n","Processing asent: She put her phone away and drew her weapon, but still would not look directly at Bowden, just in case he was not in Besel.\n","Processing asent: Perhaps we were watched by Breach, somewhere.\n","Processing asent: Bowden had not yet transgressed for their attention: they could not touch him.\n","Processing asent: I held out my hand as I walked, and I did not slow down, butCorwi gripped it and we met each others gaze a moment.\n","Processing asent: Looking back I saw her and Dhatt, metres apart in different cities, staring at me.\n","Processing asent: It was really dawn at last.\n","Processing asent: He turned.\n","Processing asent: His face was set.\n","Processing asent: Tense.\n","Processing asent: He held something the shape of which I could not make out.\n","Processing asent: Inspector Borl.\n","Processing asent: Fancy meeting you here?\n","Processing asent: He tried to grin but it did not go well.\n","Processing asent: Wheres here?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: He shrugged.\n","Processing asent: Its really impressive, what youre doing, I said.\n","Processing asent: He shrugged again, with a mannerism neither Bes nor Ul Qoman.\n","Processing asent: It would take him a day or more of walking, but Besel and Ul Qoma are small countries.\n","Processing asent: He could do it, walk out.\n","Processing asent: How expert a citizen, how consummate an urban dweller and observer, to mediate those million unnoticed mannerisms that marked out civic specificity, to refuse either aggregate of behaviours.\n","Processing asent: He aimed with whatever it was he held.\n","Processing asent: If you shoot me Breachll be on you.\n","Processing asent: If theyre watching, he said.\n","Processing asent: I think probably youre the only one here.\n","Processing asent: There are centuries of borders to shore up, after tonight.\n","Processing asent: And even if they are, its a moot question.\n","Processing asent: What kind of crime would it be?\n","Processing asent: Where areyou?\n","Processing asent: You tried to cut her face off.\n","Processing asent: That ragged under-chin slit.\n","Processing asent: Did you No, it was hers, it was her knife.\n","Processing asent: You couldnt though.\n","Processing asent: So you slathered on her makeup instead.\n","Processing asent: He blinked, said nothing.\n","Processing asent: As if that would disguise her.\n","Processing asent: What is that?\n","Processing asent: He showed the thing to me, a moment, before gripping and aiming it again.\n","Processing asent: It was some verdigrised metal object, age-gnarled and ugly.\n","Processing asent: It was clicking.\n","Processing asent: It was patched with new metal bands.\n","Processing asent: It broke.\n","Processing asent: When I.\n","Processing asent: It did not sound as if he hesitated: his words simply stopped.\n","Processing asent: Jesus, thats what you hit her with.\n","Processing asent: When you realised she knew it was lies.\n","Processing asent: Grabbed and flailed, a moments rage.\n","Processing asent: He could admit to anything now.\n","Processing asent: So long as he remained in his superposition, whose law would take him?\n","Processing asent: I saw that the things handle, that heheld, that pointed towards him, ended in an ugly sharp spike.\n","Processing asent: You grab it, smack her, she goes down.\n","Processing asent: I made stab motions.\n","Processing asent: Heat of the moment, I said.\n","Processing asent: Right?\n","Processing asent: Right?\n","Processing asent: So did you not know how to fire it, then?\n","Processing asent: Are they true, then?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: All those strange physics rumours?\n","Processing asent: Isthat one of the things Sear and Core were after?\n","Processing asent: Sending one of their ranking visitors sightseeing, scuffing their heels in the park for?\n","Processing asent: Just another tourist?\n","Processing asent: I wouldnt call it a gun, he said.\n","Processing asent: But well, want to see what it can do?\n","Processing asent: He wagged it.\n","Processing asent: Not tempted to sell it on yourself?\n","Processing asent: He looked offended.\n","Processing asent: How do you know what it does?\n","Processing asent: Im an archaeologist and an historian, he said.\n","Processing asent: And Im incredibly good at it.\n","Processing asent: And now Im going.\n","Processing asent: Walking out of the city?\n","Processing asent: He inclined his head.\n","Processing asent: Which city?\n","Processing asent: He wagged his weaponno .\n","Processing asent: I didnt mean to, you know, he said.\n","Processing asent: She was That time his words dried up.\n","Processing asent: He swallowed.\n","Processing asent: She must have been angry.\n","Processing asent: To realise how youd been lying to her.\n","Processing asent: I always told the truth.\n","Processing asent: Youheard me, Inspector.\n","Processing asent: I told you many times.\n","Processing asent: Theres no such place as Orciny.\n","Processing asent: Did you flatter her?\n","Processing asent: Did you tell her she was the only one you could admit the truth to?\n","Processing asent: Borl, I can kill you where you stand and, do you realise, no one will even know where we are.\n","Processing asent: If you were in one place or the other they might come for me, but yourenot .\n","Processing asent: The thing is, and I know it wouldnt work this way and so do you but thats becauseno one in this place, and that includes Breach, obeys the rules, their own rules, and if they did itwould work this way, the thing is that if you were to be killed by someone who no one was sure which city they were in and they werent sure whereyou were either, your body would have to lie there, rotting, forever.\n","Processing asent: People would have to step over you.\n","Processing asent: Because no one breached.\n","Processing asent: Neither Besel nor Ul Qoma could risk clearing you up.\n","Processing asent: Youd lie there stinking up both cities until you were just a stain.\n","Processing asent: I am going, Borl.\n","Processing asent: You think Besel willcome for you if I shoot you?\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma?\n","Processing asent: Corwi and Dhatt must have heard him, even if they made to unhear.\n","Processing asent: Bowden looked only at me and did not move.\n","Processing asent: My, well, Breach, my partner, was right, I said.\n","Processing asent: Even if Buric could have thought this up, he didnt have the expertise or the patience to put it together so it would have fooled Mahalia.\n","Processing asent: She was smart.\n","Processing asent: That took someone who knew the archives and the secrets and the Orciny rumours not just a bit but totally.\n","Processing asent: Completely.\n","Processing asent: You told the truth, like you say: theres no such place as Orciny.\n","Processing asent: You said it again and again.\n","Processing asent: That was the point, wasnt it?\n","Processing asent: It wasnt Burics idea, was it?\n","Processing asent: After that conference where she made such a nuisance of herself?\n","Processing asent: It certainly wasnt Sear and Corethey would have hired someone to smuggle more efficiently, a little nickel-and-dime operation like that, they just went along with an opportunity that was presented.\n","Processing asent: Sure you needed Burics resources to make it work, and he wasnt going to turn down a chance to steal from Ul Qoma, pimp Besel outhow much investment was tied to this?and make a mint for himself.\n","Processing asent: But it was your idea, and it was never about the money.\n","Processing asent: It was because you missed Orciny.\n","Processing asent: A way to have it both ways.\n","Processing asent: Yes, sure you were wrong about Orciny, but you could make it so you were right, too.\n","Processing asent: Choice artefacts had been excavated, the details of which only the archaeologists could knowor those who had left them there, as poor Yolanda had thought.\n","Processing asent: Supposed-Orciny sent their supposed-agent sudden instructions, not to be delayed, no time to think or rethinkonly, quickly, liberate, hand over.\n","Processing asent: You told Mahalia she was the only one youd tell the truth.\n","Processing asent: That when you turned your back on your book, that was just you playing politics?\n","Processing asent: Or did you tell her it was cowardice?\n","Processing asent: That would be pretty winning.\n","Processing asent: I bet you did that.\n","Processing asent: I approached him.\n","Processing asent: His expression shifted.\n","Processing asent: Its my shame, Mahalia, the pressure was too much.\n","Processing asent: Youre braver than me, keep on; youre so close, youll find it Your shit messed up your whole career, and you cant have that time back.\n","Processing asent: So the next best thing, make it have been true all along.\n","Processing asent: Im sure the money was nicecant tell me they didnt payand Burichad his reasons and Sear and Core had theirs, and the natsll do for anyone with a way with words and a buck.\n","Processing asent: But it wasOrciny that was the point for you, right?\n","Processing asent: But Mahalia figured out that it was nonsense, Doctor Bowden.\n","Processing asent: How much more perfect that unhistory would be, second time around, when he could construct the evidence not only from fragments in archives, not from the cross-reference of misunderstood documents, but could add to those planted sources, suggest partisan texts, even create messagesto himself, too, for her benefit and later for ours, that all the while he could dismiss as the nothings they werefrom the nonplace itself.\n","Processing asent: But still she worked out the truth.\n","Processing asent: That must have been unpleasant for you, I said.\n","Processing asent: His eyes were unhitched from wherever we were.\n","Processing asent: It got Thats why.\n","Processing asent: She told him her deliveriesso all secret paymentswould end.\n","Processing asent: That was not why his rage.\n","Processing asent: Did she think you were fooled too?\n","Processing asent: Or did she realise you were behind it?\n","Processing asent: It was amazing that such a detail should almost be epiphenomenal.\n","Processing asent: I think she didnt know.\n","Processing asent: It wasnt her character to taunt you.\n","Processing asent: I think she thought she wasprotecting you.\n","Processing asent: I think she arranged to meet you, to protect you.\n","Processing asent: To tell you that youd both been duped by someone.\n","Processing asent: That you were both in danger.\n","Processing asent: The rage of that attack.\n","Processing asent: The task, that post-facto vindication of a dead project, destroyed.\n","Processing asent: No point scoring, no competition.\n","Processing asent: Just the pure fact that Mahalia had, without even knowing it, outsmarted him, realised that his invention was invention, despite his attempts to seal up the creation, to watertight it.\n","Processing asent: She crushed him without guile or bile.\n","Processing asent: The evidence destroyed his conception again, the improved version, Orciny 2.0, as it had the last time, when he had actually believed it.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia died because she proved to Bowden that he had been a fool to believe the folktale he created.\n","Processing asent: What is that thing?\n","Processing asent: Did she ?\n","Processing asent: But she could not have got that out, and had she delivered it it would not be with him.\n","Processing asent: Ive had this for years, he said.This I found myself.\n","Processing asent: WhenI was first digging.\n","Processing asent: Security wasnt always like now.\n","Processing asent: Where did you meet her?\n","Processing asent: A bullshitdissensus?\n","Processing asent: Some old empty bollocks building you told her was where Orciny did their magic?\n","Processing asent: It did not matter.\n","Processing asent: The murder site would just be some empty place.\n","Processing asent: Would you believe me if I told you I really dont remember the actual moment?\n","Processing asent: he said carefully.\n","Processing asent: Just this constant, this Reasoning, that broke his creation apart.\n","Processing asent: He might have shown her the artefact as if it were evidence.Its not Orciny! she perhaps said.We have to think!\n","Processing asent: Who might want this stuff?\n","Processing asent: The fury at that.\n","Processing asent: You broke it.\n","Processing asent: Not irreparably.\n","Processing asent: Its tough.\n","Processing asent: The artefacts are tough.\n","Processing asent: Despite being used to beat her to death.\n","Processing asent: It was a good idea to take her through the checkpoint.\n","Processing asent: When I called him Buric wasnt happy sending the driver, but he understood.\n","Processing asent: Its never beenmilitsya orpoliczai that are the problem.\n","Processing asent: We couldnt let Breach notice us.\n","Processing asent: But your maps are out of date.\n","Processing asent: I saw it on your desk, that time.\n","Processing asent: All that junk you or Yorj picked upwas that from where you killed her?was useless.\n","Processing asent: When did they build that skate park?\n","Processing asent: For a moment he managed to make it sound as if he was genuinely humourous about it.\n","Processing asent: That was supposed to be direct to the estuary.\n","Processing asent: Where the old iron would pull her down.\n","Processing asent: Didnt Yorjavic know his way around?\n","Processing asent: Its his city.\n","Processing asent: Some soldier.\n","Processing asent: He never had reason to go to Pocost.\n","Processing asent: I hadnt been over since the conference.\n","Processing asent: I bought that map I gave him years ago, and it was right last time I was there.\n","Processing asent: But goddamn urban renewal, right?\n","Processing asent: There he was, van all loaded up, and theres ramps and half-pipes between him and the water, and lights coming.\n","Processing asent: When that went wrong, that was when Buric and you fell out.\n","Processing asent: Not really.\n","Processing asent: We had words, but we thought it had blown over.\n","Processing asent: No, what got him troubled was whenyou came to Ul Qoma, he said.\n","Processing asent: That was when he realised there was trouble.\n","Processing asent: So in a way I owe you an apology He tried to shrug.\n","Processing asent: Even that motion was urbanly undecidable.\n","Processing asent: He kept swallowing but his tics gave away nothing about where he was.\n","Processing asent: If you like, he said.\n","Processing asent: Thats when he set his True Citizens on hunt.\n","Processing asent: Even tried to get you blaming Qoma First, with that bomb.And I think he thoughtI believed it, too.\n","Processing asent: Bowden looked disgusted.\n","Processing asent: He mustve heard about the time it happened before.\n","Processing asent: For real.\n","Processing asent: All those notes you wrote in Precursor, threatening yourself to get us off you.\n","Processing asent: Fake burglaries.\n","Processing asent: Added to your Orciny.\n","Processing asent: How he looked at me, I stopped myself sayingYour bullshit .\n","Processing asent: What about Yolanda?\n","Processing asent: Im really sorry about her.\n","Processing asent: Buric must have thought she and I were that Mahalia or Id told her something.\n","Processing asent: You hadnt, though.\n","Processing asent: Nor did Mahaliashe protected her from all that.\n","Processing asent: In fact Yolanda was the only one who believed in Orciny all the way along.\n","Processing asent: She was your biggest fan.\n","Processing asent: Her and Aikam.\n","Processing asent: He stared, his face cold.\n","Processing asent: He knew that neither of them were the smartest.\n","Processing asent: I did not say anything for a minute.\n","Processing asent: Christ youre a liar, Bowden, I said.\n","Processing asent: Even now, Jesus.\n","Processing asent: Do you think I dont know it was you who told Buric Yolandad be there?\n","Processing asent: I spoke and I could hear his shaking breath.\n","Processing asent: You sent them there in case of what she knew.\n","Processing asent: Which as I say was nothing.\n","Processing asent: You had her killed for nothing.\n","Processing asent: But why didyou come?\n","Processing asent: You knew theyd try to kill you too.\n","Processing asent: We faced each other for a long silence.\n","Processing asent: You needed to be sure, didnt you?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: And so did they.\n","Processing asent: They wouldnt send out Yorjavic and organise that extraordinary cross-border assassination for Yolanda alone.\n","Processing asent: They did not even know for sure what if anything she knew.\n","Processing asent: Bowden, though: they knew what he knew.\n","Processing asent: Everything.\n","Processing asent: They thought I believed it too , he had said.\n","Processing asent: You told them shed be there, and that you were coming too because Qoma First were trying to kill you.\n","Processing asent: Did they really think youd believed it?\n","Processing asent: But they could check, couldnt they?\n","Processing asent: I answered myself.\n","Processing asent: By if you turned up.\n","Processing asent: Youhad to be there, or theyd know they were being played.\n","Processing asent: If Yorjavic hadnt seen you hed have known you were planning something.\n","Processing asent: He had to have both targets there.\n","Processing asent: Bowdens strange gait and manner at the hall.\n","Processing asent: So you had to turn up and try and keep someone in his way I stopped.\n","Processing asent: Were there three targets?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: I was the reason it had gone wrong, after all.\n","Processing asent: I shook my head.\n","Processing asent: You knew theyd try to kill you, but it was worth the risk to get ridof her.\n","Processing asent: Camouflage.\n","Processing asent: Who would suspect him of complicity, after Orciny tried to kill him?\n","Processing asent: He had a slowly souring face.\n","Processing asent: Where is Buric?\n","Processing asent: Good.\n","Processing asent: Good\n","Processing asent: I stepped towards him.\n","Processing asent: He pointed the artefact at me like some stubby Bronze Age wand.\n","Processing asent: What do you care?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: What are you going to do?\n","Processing asent: How long have you lived in the cities?\n","Processing asent: Now what?\n","Processing asent: Its over.\n","Processing asent: Orcinys rubble.\n","Processing asent: Another step, he still aiming at me, mouth-breathing and eyes wide.\n","Processing asent: Youve got one option.\n","Processing asent: Youve been to Besel.\n","Processing asent: Youve lived in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Theres one place left.\n","Processing asent: Come on.\n","Processing asent: You going to live anonymous in Istanbul?\n","Processing asent: In Sebastopol?\n","Processing asent: Make it to Paris?\n","Processing asent: You think thats going to be enough?\n","Processing asent: Orciny is bullshit.\n","Processing asent: Do you want to see whats really in between?\n","Processing asent: A second held.\n","Processing asent: He hesitated long enough for some appearance.\n","Processing asent: Nasty broken man.\n","Processing asent: The only thing more despicable than what he had done was the half-hidden eagerness with which he now took me up on my offer.\n","Processing asent: It was not bravery on his part to come with me.\n","Processing asent: He held out that heavy weapon thing to me and I took it.\n","Processing asent: It rattled.\n","Processing asent: The bulb full of gears, the old clockworks that had cut Mahalias head when the metal burst.\n","Processing asent: He sagged, with some moan: apology, plea, relief.\n","Processing asent: I was not listening and dont remember.\n","Processing asent: I did not arrest himI was notpoliczai , not then, and Breach do not arrestbut I had him, and exhaled, because it was over.\n","Processing asent: BOWDEN HAD STILL NOT COMMITTEDto where he was.\n","Processing asent: I said, Which city are you in?\n","Processing asent: Dhatt and Corwi were close, ready, and whichever shared a locus with him would come forward when he said.\n","Processing asent: Either, he said.\n","Processing asent: So I grabbed him by the scruff, turned him, marched him away.\n","Processing asent: Under the authority Id been granted, I dragged Breach with me, enveloped him in it, pulled him out of either town into neither, intothe Breach.\n","Processing asent: Corwi and Dhatt watched me take him out of either of their reaches.\n","Processing asent: I nodded thanks to them across their borders.\n","Processing asent: They would not look at each other, but both nodded to me.\n","Processing asent: It occurred as I led Bowden shuffling with me that the breach I had been empowered to pursue, that I was still investigating and of which he was evidence, was still my own.\n","Processing asent: Chapter Twenty-Nine\n","Processing asent: I DID NOT SEE THAT MACHINE AGAIN.\n","Processing asent: It was funnelled into the bureaucracy of Breach.\n","Processing asent: I never saw whatever it was it could do, whatever Sear and Core wanted, or if it could do anything.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qoma in the aftermath of Riot Night was buoyed up with tension.\n","Processing asent: Themilitsya , even after the remaining unifs had been cleared out or arrested, or hidden their patches and disappeared, kept up high-profile, intrusive policing.\n","Processing asent: Civil libertarians complained.\n","Processing asent: Ul Qomas government announced a new campaign, Vigilant Neighbours, neighbourliness referring both to the people next door (what were they doing?) and to the connected city (see how important borders are?).\n","Processing asent: In Besel the night led to a kind of exaggerated mutedness.\n","Processing asent: It became almost bad luck to mention it.\n","Processing asent: The newspapers massively played it down.\n","Processing asent: Politicians, if they said anything, made circuitous mentionof recent stresses or similar.\n","Processing asent: But there was a pall.\n","Processing asent: The city was subdued.\n","Processing asent: Its unif population was as depleted, the remnants as careful and out of sight, as in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Both cleanups were fast.\n","Processing asent: The Breach closure lasted thirty-six hours and was not mentioned again.\n","Processing asent: The night led to twenty-two deaths in Ul Qoma, thirteen in Besel, not including the refugees who died after the initial accidents, nor the disappeared.\n","Processing asent: Now therewere more foreign journalists in both sets of streets, doing more and less subtle follow-up reports.\n","Processing asent: They made regular attempts to arrange an interviewanonymous, of coursewith representatives of Breach.\n","Processing asent: Has anyone from Breach ever broken ranks?\n","Processing asent: I said.\n","Processing asent: Of course, said Ashil.\n","Processing asent: But then theyre breaching, theyre insiles, and theyre ours.\n","Processing asent: He walked carefully, and wore bandages below his clothes and his hidden armour.\n","Processing asent: The first day after the riots, when I returned to the office dragging a semicompliant Bowden with me, I was locked into my cell.\n","Processing asent: But the door had been unlocked since then.\n","Processing asent: I had spent three days with Ashil, since his release from whatever hidden hospital it was where Breach received care.\n","Processing asent: Each day he spent in my company, we walked the cities, in the Breach.\n","Processing asent: I was learning from him how to walk between them, first in one, then the other, or in either, but without the ostentation of Bowdens extraordinary motiona more covert equivocation.\n","Processing asent: How could he do it?\n","Processing asent: Walk like that?\n","Processing asent: Hes been a student of the cities, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Maybe it took an outsider to really see how citizens mark themselves, so as to walk between it.\n","Processing asent: Where is he?\n","Processing asent: I had asked Ashil this many times.\n","Processing asent: He evaded answering in various ways.\n","Processing asent: That time he said, as he had before, There are mechanisms.\n","Processing asent: Hes taken care of.\n","Processing asent: It was overcast and dark, lightly raining.\n","Processing asent: I turned up the collar of my coat.\n","Processing asent: We were west of the river, by the crosshatched rails, a short stretch of tracks used by the trains of both cities, the timetable agreed internationally.\n","Processing asent: But the thing is, he never breached.\n","Processing asent: I had not voiced this anxiety to Ashil before.\n","Processing asent: He turned to look at me, massaged his injury.\n","Processing asent: Under what authority was he How can we have him?\n","Processing asent: Ashil walked us around the environs of the Bol Yean dig.\n","Processing asent: I could hear the trains in Besel, north of us, in Ul Qoma to the south.\n","Processing asent: We would not go in, or even near enough to Bol Yean to be seen, but Ashil was walking through the various stages of the case, without saying so.\n","Processing asent: I mean, I said, I know Breach doesnt answer to anyone, but it you have to present reports.\n","Processing asent: Of all your cases.\n","Processing asent: To the Oversight Committee.\n","Processing asent: He raised an eyebrow at that.\n","Processing asent: I know, I know theyve been discredited because of Buric, but their lines that that was the makeup of the members, right, not the committee itself.\n","Processing asent: The checks and balances between the cities and Breach is still the same, right?\n","Processing asent: They have a point, dont you think?\n","Processing asent: So youll have to justify taking Bowden.\n","Processing asent: No one cares about Bowden, he said at last.\n","Processing asent: Not Ul Qoma, not Besel, not Canada, not Orciny.\n","Processing asent: But yes, well present a form to them.\n","Processing asent: Maybe, after he dumped Mahalia, he got back into Ul Qoma by Breach.\n","Processing asent: He didnt dump her; it was Yorj I said.\n","Processing asent: Maybe thats how he did it, Ashil continued.\n","Processing asent: Well see.\n","Processing asent: Maybe well push him into Besel and pull him back to Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: If we say he breached, he breached.\n","Processing asent: I looked at him.\n","Processing asent: Mahalia was gone.\n","Processing asent: Her body had at last gone home.\n","Processing asent: Ashil told me on the day her parents held her funeral.\n","Processing asent: Sear and Core had not left Besel.\n","Processing asent: It would risk attention to pull out after the creeping, confused revelations of Burics behaviour.\n","Processing asent: The company and its tech arm had come up, but the chains of connection were vague.\n","Processing asent: Burics possible contact was a regrettable unknown, and mistakes had been made, safeguards were being put in place.\n","Processing asent: There were rumours that CorIntech would be sold.\n","Processing asent: Ashil and I went by tram, by Metro, by bus, by taxi, we walked.\n","Processing asent: He threaded us like a suture in and out of Besel and Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: What about my breach?\n","Processing asent: I asked it at last.\n","Processing asent: We had both been waiting for days.\n","Processing asent: I did not askWhen do I get to go back home?\n","Processing asent: We took the funicular to the top of the park named for it, in Besel at least.\n","Processing asent: If hed had an up-to-date map of Besel youd never have found her, Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: Orciny.\n","Processing asent: He shook his head.\n","Processing asent: Do you see any children in the Breach?\n","Processing asent: he said.\n","Processing asent: How would that workif any were born?\n","Processing asent: They must be, I interrupted, but he talked over me. how could they live here?\n","Processing asent: The clouds over the cities were dramatic, andI watched them, rather than him, and pictured children given up.\n","Processing asent: You know how I was made Breach, he suddenly said.\n","Processing asent: When do I get to go home?\n","Processing asent: I said pointlessly.\n","Processing asent: He even smiled at that.\n","Processing asent: You did an excellent job.\n","Processing asent: Youve seen how we work.\n","Processing asent: Nowhere else works like the cities, he said.\n","Processing asent: Its not just us keeping them apart.\n","Processing asent: Its everyone in Besel and everyone in Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: Every minute, every day.\n","Processing asent: Were only the last ditch: its everyone in the cities who does most of the work.\n","Processing asent: It works because you dont blink.\n","Processing asent: Thats why unseeing and unsensing are so vital.\n","Processing asent: No one can admit it doesnt work.\n","Processing asent: So if you dont admit it, it does.\n","Processing asent: But if you breach, even if its not your fault, for more than the shortest time you cant come back from that.\n","Processing asent: Accidents.\n","Processing asent: Road accidents, fires, inadvertent breaches\n","Processing asent: Yes.\n","Processing asent: Of course.\n","Processing asent: If you race to get out again.\n","Processing asent: If thats your response to the Breach, then maybe youve got a chance.\n","Processing asent: But even then youre in trouble.\n","Processing asent: And if its any longer than a moment, you cant get out again.\n","Processing asent: Youll never unsee again.\n","Processing asent: Most people who breach, well, youll find out about our sanctions soon.\n","Processing asent: But there is another possibility, very occasionally.\n","Processing asent: What do you know about the British Navy?\n","Processing asent: Ashil said.\n","Processing asent: A few centuries ago?\n","Processing asent: I looked at him.\n","Processing asent: I was recruited the same as everyone else in Breach.\n","Processing asent: None of us were born here.\n","Processing asent: We were all once in one place or the other.\n","Processing asent: All of us breached once.\n","Processing asent: There were many minutes of silence between us.\n","Processing asent: There are people Id like to call, I said.\n","Processing asent: HE WAS RIGHT.\n","Processing asent: I imagined myself in Besel now, unseeing the Ul Qoma of the crosshatched terrain.\n","Processing asent: Living in half of the space.\n","Processing asent: Unseeing all the people and the architecture and vehicles and the everything in and among which I had lived.\n","Processing asent: I could pretend, perhaps, at best, but something would happen, and Breach would know.\n","Processing asent: It was a big case, he said.\n","Processing asent: The biggest ever.\n","Processing asent: Youll never have so big a case again.\n","Processing asent: Im a detective, I said.\n","Processing asent: Jesus.\n","Processing asent: Do I have any choice?\n","Processing asent: Of course, he said.\n","Processing asent: Youre here.\n","Processing asent: Theres Breach, and theres those who breach, those to whom we happen.\n","Processing asent: He did not look at me but out over the overlapping cities.\n","Processing asent: Are any volunteers?\n","Processing asent: Volunteerings an early and strong indication that youre not suited, he said.\n","Processing asent: We walked towards my old flat, my press-ganger and I.\n","Processing asent: Can I say good-bye to anyone?\n","Processing asent: There are people I want to\n","Processing asent: No, he said.\n","Processing asent: We walked.\n","Processing asent: Im a detective, I said again.\n","Processing asent: Not a, whatever.\n","Processing asent: I dont work like you do.\n","Processing asent: Thats what we want.\n","Processing asent: Thats why we were so glad you breached.\n","Processing asent: Times are changing.\n","Processing asent: So the methods may not be so unfamiliar as I feared.\n","Processing asent: There may be others who proceed the traditional Breach way, the levering of intimidation, that self-styling as a night-fear, while Iusing the siphoned-off information we filch online, the bugged phone calls from both cities, the networks of informants, the powers beyond any law, the centuries of fear, yes, too, sometimes, the intimations of other powers beyond us, of unknown shapes, that we are only avatarswas to investigate, as I have investigated for years.\n","Processing asent: A new broom.\n","Processing asent: Every office needs one.\n","Processing asent: Theres a humour to the situation.\n","Processing asent: I want to see Sariska.\n","Processing asent: You know who she is, I guess.\n","Processing asent: And Biszaya.\n","Processing asent: I want to talk to Corwi, and Dhatt.\n","Processing asent: To say good-bye at least.\n","Processing asent: He was quiet for a while.\n","Processing asent: You cant talk to them.\n","Processing asent: This is how we work.\n","Processing asent: If we dont have that, we dont have anything.\n","Processing asent: But you can see them.\n","Processing asent: If you stay out of sight.\n","Processing asent: We compromised.\n","Processing asent: I wrote letters to my erstwhile lovers.\n","Processing asent: Handwritten and delivered by hand, but not by my hand.\n","Processing asent: I did not tell Sariska or Biszaya anything but that I would miss them.\n","Processing asent: I was not just being kind.\n","Processing asent: My colleagues I came close to, and though I did not speak to them, both of them could see me.\n","Processing asent: But Dhatt in Ul Qoma, and later Corwi in Besel, could tell I was not, or not totally, or not only, in their city.\n","Processing asent: They did not speak to me.\n","Processing asent: They would not risk it.\n","Processing asent: Dhatt I saw as he emerged from his office.\n","Processing asent: He stopped short at the sight of me. I stood by a hoarding outside an Ul Qoman office, with my head down so he could tell it was me but not my expression.\n","Processing asent: I raised my hand to him.\n","Processing asent: He hesitated a long time then spread his fingers, a waveless wave.\n","Processing asent: I backed into the shadows.\n","Processing asent: He walked away first.\n","Processing asent: Corwi was at a caf.\n","Processing asent: She was in Besels Ul Qomatown.\n","Processing asent: She made me smile.\n","Processing asent: I watched her drinking her creamy Ul Qoman tea in the establishment I had shown her.\n","Processing asent: I watched her from the shade of an alley for several seconds before I realised that she was looking right at me, that she knew I was there.\n","Processing asent: It was she who said good-bye to me, with a raised cup, tipped in salute.\n","Processing asent: I mouthed at her, though even she could not have seen it, thanks, and good-bye.\n","Processing asent: I have a great deal to learn, and no choice but to learn it, or to go rogue, and there is no one hunted like a Breach renegade.\n","Processing asent: So, not ready for that or the revenge of my new community of bare, extracity lives, I make my choice of those two nonchoices.\n","Processing asent: My task is changed: not to uphold the law, or another law, but to maintain the skin that keeps law in place.\n","Processing asent: Two laws in two places, in fact.\n","Processing asent: That is the end of the case of Orciny and the archaeologists, the last case of Inspector Tyador Borl of the Besel Extreme Crime Squad.\n","Processing asent: Inspector Tyador Borl is gone.\n","Processing asent: I sign off Tye, avatar of Breach, following my mentor on my probation out of Besel and out of Ul Qoma.\n","Processing asent: We are all philosophers here where I am, and we debate among many other things the question of where it is that we live.\n","Processing asent: On that issue I am a
