1319,"For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.",for this purpose after long consideration i can think of but two way to preserve them one be to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground and to drive them into it every night and the other be to enclose two or three little bit of land remote from one another and a much conceal a i can where i may keep about half a dozen young goat in each place so that if any disaster happen to the flock in general i may be able to raise them again with little trouble and time and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour i think be the much rational design

1322,"I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.",i immediately go to work with this piece of grind and in little than a month s time i have so fence it round that my flock or herd call it which you please which be not so wild now a at ﻿1 they may be suppose to be be good enough secure in it so without any far delay i remove ten young she goat and two he goat to this piece and when they be there i continue to perfect the fence till i have make it a secure a the other which however i do at much leisure and it take me up much time by a great deal
1323,"All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a man's foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man.",all this labour i be at the expense of purely from my apprehension on account of the print of a man s foot for a yet i have never see any human creature come near the island and i have now live two year under this uneasiness which indeed make my life much little comfortable than it be before a may be good imagine by any who know what it be to live in the constant snare of the fear of man
1324,"And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.",and this i must observe with grief too that the discomposure of my mind have great impression also upon the religious part of my thought for the dread and terror of fall into the hand of savage and cannibal lie so upon my spirit that i seldom find myself in a due temper for application to my maker at little not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which i be will not to do i rather pray to god a under great affliction and pressure of mind surround with danger and in expectation every night of be murder and devour before morning and i must testify from my experience that a temper of peace thankfulness love and affection be much the much proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure and that under the dread of mischief impend a man be no much fit for a comfort performance of the duty of pray to god than he be for a repentance on a sick bed for this discomposures affect the mind a the other do the body and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be a great a disability a that of the body and much great pray to god be properly a act of the mind not of the body

1326,"After I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance.",after i have thus secure one part of my little live stock i go about the whole island search for another private place to make such another deposit when wander much to the west point of the island than i have ever do yet and look out to sea i think i see a boat upon the sea at a great distance

1328,"When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined: and but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.",when i be come down the hill to the end of the island where indeed i have never be before i be presently convince that the see the print of a man s foot be not such a strange thing in the island a i imagine and but that it be a special providence that i be cast upon the side of the island where the savage never come i should easily have know that nothing be much frequent than for the canoe from the main when they happen to be a little too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour likewise a they often meet and fight in their canoe the victor have take any prisoner would bring them over to this shore where accord to their dreadful custom be all cannibal they would kill and eat them of which hereafter

1331,"I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.",i be so astonish with the sight of this thing that i entertain no notion of any danger to myself from it for a long while all my apprehension be bury in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman hellish brutality and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature which though i have hear of it often yet i never have so near a view of before in short i turn away my face from the horrid spectacle my stomach grow sick and i be just at the point of faint when nature discharge the disorder from my stomach and have vomit with uncommon violence i be a little relieve but can not bear to stay in the place a moment so i get up the hill again with all the speed i can and walk on towards my own habitation
1332,"When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.",when i come a little out of that part of the island i stand still awhile a amaze and then recover myself i look up with the utmost affection of my soul and with a flood of tear in my eye give god thank that have cast my ﻿1 lot in a part of the world where i be distinguish from such dreadful creature a this and that though i have esteem my present condition very miserable have yet give me so many comfort in it that i have still much to give thank for than to complain of and this above all that i have even in this miserable condition be comfort with the knowledge of himself and the hope of his bless which be a felicity much than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which i have suffer or can suffer
1333,"In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.",in this frame of thankfulness i go home to my castle and begin to be much easy now a to the safety of my circumstance than ever i be before for i observe that this wretch never come to this island in search of what they can get perhaps not seek not want or not expect anything here and have often no doubt be up the cover woody part of it without find anything to their purpose

1335,"Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantationsviz.",yet i entertain such a abhorrence of the savage wretch that i have be speak of and of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour and eat one another up that i continue pensive and sad and keep close within my own circle for almost two year after this when i say my own circle i mean by it my three plantationsviz

1338,"Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it.",time however and the satisfaction i have that i be in no danger of be discover by this people begin to wear off my uneasiness about them and i begin to live just in the same compose manner a before only with this difference that i use much caution and keep my eye much about me than i do before lest i should happen to be see by any of them and particularly i be much cautious of fire my gun lest any of them be on the island should happen to hear it
1339,"It was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt.",it be therefore a very good providence to me that i have furnish myself with a tame breed of goat and that i have no need to hunt any much about the wood or shoot at them and if i do catch any of them after this it be by trap and snare a i have do before so that for two year after this i believe i never fire my gun once off though i never go out without it and what be much a i have save three pistol out of the ship i always carry them out with me or at little two of them stick them in my goat skin belt

1413,"As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my family.",a for my cat they multiply a i have observe to that degree that i be oblige to shoot several of them at ﻿1 to keep them from devour me and all i have but at length when the two old one i bring with me be go and after some time continually drive them from me and let them have no provision with me they all run wild into the wood except two or three favourite which i keep tame and whose young when they have any i always drown and this be part of my family

1416,"But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into.",but it be otherwise direct and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it how frequently in the course of our live the evil which in itself we seek much to shun and which when we be fall into be the much dreadful to us be oftentimes the very mean or door of our deliverance by which alone we can be raise again from the affliction we be fall into

1418,"It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning, even before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.",it be now the month of december a i say above in my twenty 3 year and this be the southern solstice for winter i can not call it be the particular time of my harvest and require me to be pretty much abroad in the field when go out early in the morning even before it be thorough daylight i be surprise with see a light of some fire upon the shore at a distance from me of about two mile toward that part of the island where i have observe some savage have be a before and not on the other side but to my great affliction it be on my side of the island
1419,"I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest till they had found me out.",i be indeed terribly surprise at the sight and stop short within my grove not dare to go out lest i may be surprise and yet i have no much peace within from the apprehension i have that if this savage in ramble over the island should find my corn stand or cut or any of my work or improvement they would immediately conclude that there be people in the place and would then never rest till they have find me out

1427,"It is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so near to me; but when I considered their coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on shore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the more composure.",it be not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into especially see them come on my side of the island and so near to me but when i consider their come must be always with the current of the ebb i begin afterwards to be much sedate in my mind be satisfy that i may go abroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide if they be not on shore before and have make this observation i go abroad about my harvest work with the much composure

1435,"It seemed evident to me that the visits which they made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there againthat is to say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far.",it seem evident to me that the visit which they make thus to this island be not very frequent for it be above fifteen month before any much of them come on shore there againthat be to say i neither see them nor any footstep or signal of them in all that time for a to the rainy season then they be sure not to come abroad at little not so far

1439,"And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what to expect.",and now i find to my great comfort how happy it be that i have provide a tame flock or herd of goat for i durst not upon any account fire my gun especially near that side of the island where they usually come lest i should alarm the savage and if they have flee from me now i be sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoe with them in a few day and then i know what to expect

1448,"I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat.",i start up in the great haste imaginable and in a trice clap my ladder to the middle place of the rock and pull it after me and mount it the 2 time get to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a 2 gun which accordingly in about half a minute i hear and by the sound know that it be from that part of the sea where i be drive down the current in my boat

1450,"I had the presence of mind at that minute to think, that though I could not help them, it might be that they might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill.",i have the presence of mind at that minute to think that though i can not help them it may be that they may help me so i bring together all the dry wood i can get at hand and make a good handsome pile i set it on fire upon the hill

1453,"I plied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguishno, not with my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.",i ply my fire all night long till daybreak and when it be broad day and the air clear up i see something at a great distance at sea full east of the island whether a sail or a hull i can not distinguishno not with my glass the distance be so great and the weather still something hazy also at little it be so out at sea
1454,"I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life.",i look frequently at it all that day and soon perceive that it do not move so i presently conclude that it be a ship at anchor and be eager you may be sure to be satisfy i take my gun in my hand and run towards the south side of the island to the rock where i have formerly be carry away by the current and get up there the weather by this time be perfectly clear i can plainly see to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon that conceal rock which i find when i be out in my boat and which rock a they check the violence of the stream and make a kind of counter stream or eddy be the occasion of my recover from the much desperate hopeless condition that ever i have be in in all my life

1456,"Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.",have they see the island a i must necessarily suppose they do not they must a i think have endeavour to have save themselves on shore by the help of their boat but their fire off gun for help especially when they see a i imagine my fire fill me with many thought

1458,"Other times I imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands.",other time i imagine that they may have lose their boat before a may be the case many way particularly by the break of the sea upon their ship which many time oblige man to stave or take in piece their boat and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hand

1460,"Other times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.",other time i fancy they be all go off to sea in their boat and be hurry away by the current that i have be formerly in be carry out into the great ocean where there be nothing but misery and perish and that perhaps they may by this time think of starve and of be in a condition to eat one another
1461,"As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships' companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared but mine.",a all this be but conjecture at well so in the condition i be in i can do no much than look on upon the misery of the poor man and pity them which have still this good effect upon my side that it give me much and much because to give thank to god who have so happily and comfortably provide for me in my desolate condition and that of two ship company who be now cast away upon this part of the world not one life should be spare but mine

1463,"Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing.",such certainly be the case of this man of whom i can not so much a see room to suppose any be save nothing can make it rational so much a to wish or expect that they do not all perish there except the possibility only of their be take up by another ship in company and this be but mere possibility indeed for i see not the little sign or appearance of any such thing
