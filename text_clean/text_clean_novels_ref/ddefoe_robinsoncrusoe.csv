1311,"In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.",in the inside of this i thicken my wall to about ten foot thick with continually bring earth out of my cave and lay it at the foot of the wall and walk upon it and through the seven hole i contrive to plant the musket of which i take notice that i have get seven on shore out of the ship this i plant like my cannon and fit them into frame that hold them like a carriage so that i can fire all the seven gun in two minute time this wall i be many a weary month in finish and yet never think myself safe till it be do
1312,"When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall.",when this be do i stick all the grind without my wall for a great length every way a full with stake or stick of the osier like wood which i find so apt to grow a they can good stand insomuch that i believe i may set in near twenty thousand of them leave a pretty large space between them and my wall that i may have room to see a enemy and they may have no shelter from the young tree if they attempt to approach my outer wall
1313,"Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what kind soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation.",thus in two year time i have a thick grove and in five or six year time i have a wood before my dwell grow so monstrously thick and strong that it be indeed perfectly impassable and no man of what kind soever can ever imagine that there be anything beyond it much little a habitation
1314,"As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down no man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.",a for the way which i propose to myself to go in and out for i leave no avenue it be by set two ladder one to a part of the rock which be low and then break in and leave room to place another ladder upon that so when the two ladder be take down no man live can come down to me without do himself mischief and if they have come down they be still on the outside of my outer wall
1315,Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.,thus i take all the measure human prudence can suggest for my own preservation and it will be see at length that they be not altogether without just reason though i foresee nothing at that time much than my mere fear suggest to me

1317,A CAVE RETREAT,a cave retreat
1318,"While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.",while this be do i be not altogether careless of my other affair for i have a great concern upon me for my little herd of goat they be not only a ready supply to me on every occasion and begin to be sufficient for me without the expense of powder and shoot but also without the fatigue of hunt after the wild one and i be loath to lose the advantage of them and to have them all to nurse up over again
1319,"For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.",for this purpose after long consideration i can think of but two way to preserve them one be to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground and to drive them into it every night and the other be to enclose two or three little bit of land remote from one another and a much conceal a i can where i may keep about half a dozen young goat in each place so that if any disaster happen to the flock in general i may be able to raise them again with little trouble and time and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour i think be the much rational design
1320,"Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the island.",accordingly i spend some time to find out the much retire part of the island and i pitch upon one which be a private indeed a my heart can wish it be a little damp piece of grind in the middle of the hollow and thick wood where a be observe i almost lose myself once before endeavour to come back that way from the eastern part of the island
1321,"Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other piece of ground I had worked so hard at.",here i find a clear piece of land near three acre so surround with wood that it be almost a enclosure by nature at little it do not want near so much labour to make it so a the other piece of grind i have work so hard at
1322,"I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.",i immediately go to work with this piece of grind and in little than a month s time i have so fence it round that my flock or herd call it which you please which be not so wild now a at ï»¿1 they may be suppose to be be good enough secure in it so without any far delay i remove ten young she goat and two he goat to this piece and when they be there i continue to perfect the fence till i have make it a secure a the other which however i do at much leisure and it take me up much time by a great deal
1323,"All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a man's foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man.",all this labour i be at the expense of purely from my apprehension on account of the print of a man s foot for a yet i have never see any human creature come near the island and i have now live two year under this uneasiness which indeed make my life much little comfortable than it be before a may be good imagine by any who know what it be to live in the constant snare of the fear of man
1324,"And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.",and this i must observe with grief too that the discomposure of my mind have great impression also upon the religious part of my thought for the dread and terror of fall into the hand of savage and cannibal lie so upon my spirit that i seldom find myself in a due temper for application to my maker at little not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which i be will not to do i rather pray to god a under great affliction and pressure of mind surround with danger and in expectation every night of be murder and devour before morning and i must testify from my experience that a temper of peace thankfulness love and affection be much the much proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure and that under the dread of mischief impend a man be no much fit for a comfort performance of the duty of pray to god than he be for a repentance on a sick bed for this discomposures affect the mind a the other do the body and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be a great a disability a that of the body and much great pray to god be properly a act of the mind not of the body
1325,But to go on.,but to go on
1326,"After I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance.",after i have thus secure one part of my little live stock i go about the whole island search for another private place to make such another deposit when wander much to the west point of the island than i have ever do yet and look out to sea i think i see a boat upon the sea at a great distance
1327,"I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was a boat or not I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my pocket.",i have find a perspective glass or two in one of the seaman s chest which i save out of our ship but i have it not about me and this be so remote that i can not tell what to make of it though i look at it till my eye be not able to hold to look any long whether it be a boat or not i do not know but a i descend from the hill i can see no much of it so i give it over only i resolve to go no much out without a perspective glass in my pocket
1328,"When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined: and but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.",when i be come down the hill to the end of the island where indeed i have never be before i be presently convince that the see the print of a man s foot be not such a strange thing in the island a i imagine and but that it be a special providence that i be cast upon the side of the island where the savage never come i should easily have know that nothing be much frequent than for the canoe from the main when they happen to be a little too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour likewise a they often meet and fight in their canoe the victor have take any prisoner would bring them over to this shore where accord to their dreadful custom be all cannibal they would kill and eat them of which hereafter

1330,"point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.",point of the island i be perfectly confound and amaze nor be it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at see the shore spread with skull hand foot and other bone of human body and particularly i observe a place where there have be a fire make and a circle dig in the earth like a cockpit where i suppose the savage wretch have sit down to their human feastings upon the body of their fellow creature
1331,"I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.",i be so astonish with the sight of this thing that i entertain no notion of any danger to myself from it for a long while all my apprehension be bury in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman hellish brutality and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature which though i have hear of it often yet i never have so near a view of before in short i turn away my face from the horrid spectacle my stomach grow sick and i be just at the point of faint when nature discharge the disorder from my stomach and have vomit with uncommon violence i be a little relieve but can not bear to stay in the place a moment so i get up the hill again with all the speed i can and walk on towards my own habitation
1332,"When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.",when i come a little out of that part of the island i stand still awhile a amaze and then recover myself i look up with the utmost affection of my soul and with a flood of tear in my eye give god thank that have cast my ï»¿1 lot in a part of the world where i be distinguish from such dreadful creature a this and that though i have esteem my present condition very miserable have yet give me so many comfort in it that i have still much to give thank for than to complain of and this above all that i have even in this miserable condition be comfort with the knowledge of himself and the hope of his bless which be a felicity much than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which i have suffer or can suffer
1333,"In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.",in this frame of thankfulness i go home to my castle and begin to be much easy now a to the safety of my circumstance than ever i be before for i observe that this wretch never come to this island in search of what they can get perhaps not seek not want or not expect anything here and have often no doubt be up the cover woody part of it without find anything to their purpose
1334,"I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.",i know i have be here now almost eighteen year and never see the little footstep of human creature there before and i may be eighteen year much a entirely conceal a i be now if i do not discover myself to them which i have no manner of occasion to do it be my only business to keep myself entirely conceal where i be unless i find a well sort of creature than cannibal to make myself know to
1335,"Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantationsviz.",yet i entertain such a abhorrence of the savage wretch that i have be speak of and of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour and eat one another up that i continue pensive and sad and keep close within my own circle for almost two year after this when i say my own circle i mean by it my three plantationsviz
1336,"my castle, my country seat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself.",my castle my country seat which i call my bower and my enclosure in the wood nor do i look after this for any other use than a enclosure for my goat for the aversion which nature give me to this hellish wretch be such that i be a fearful of see them a of see the devil himself
1337,"I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of making another; for I could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.",i do not so much a go to look after my boat all this time but begin rather to think of make another for i can not think of ever make any much attempt to bring the other boat round the island to me lest i should meet with some of this creature at sea in which case if i have happen to have fall into their hand i know what would have be my lot
1338,"Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it.",time however and the satisfaction i have that i be in no danger of be discover by this people begin to wear off my uneasiness about them and i begin to live just in the same compose manner a before only with this difference that i use much caution and keep my eye much about me than i do before lest i should happen to be see by any of them and particularly i be much cautious of fire my gun lest any of them be on the island should happen to hear it
1339,"It was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt.",it be therefore a very good providence to me that i have furnish myself with a tame breed of goat and that i have no need to hunt any much about the wood or shoot at them and if i do catch any of them after this it be by trap and snare a i have do before so that for two year after this i believe i never fire my gun once off though i never go out without it and what be much a i have save three pistol out of the ship i always carry them out with me or at little two of them stick them in my goat skin belt
1340,"I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself the particular of two pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.",i also furbish up one of the great cutlass that i have out of the ship and make me a belt to hang it on also so that i be now a much formidable fellow to look at when i go abroad if you add to the former description of myself the particular of two pistol and a broadsword hang at my side in a belt but without a scabbard
1341,"Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way of living.",thing go on thus a i have say for some time i seem except this caution to be reduce to my former calm sedate way of live
1342,"All these things tended to show me more and more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.",all this thing tend to show me much and much how far my condition be from be miserable compare to some other nay to many other particular of life which it may have please god to have make my lot
1343,"It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their condition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.",it put me upon reflect how little repine there would be among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their condition with that that be wrong in order to be thankful than be always compare them with that which be well to assist their murmurings and complainings
1344,"As in my present condition there were not really many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.",a in my present condition there be not really many thing which i want so indeed i think that the fright i have be in about this savage wretch and the concern i have be in for my own preservation have take off the edge of my invention for my own convenience and i have drop a good design which i have once bend my thought upon and that be to try if i can not make some of my barley into malt and then try to brew myself some beer
1345,"This was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose.",this be really a whimsical think and i reprove myself often for the simplicity of it for i presently see there would be the want of several thing necessary to the make my beer that it would be impossible for me to supply a ï»¿1 cask to preserve it in which be a thing that a i have observe already i can never compass no though i spend not only many day but week nay month in attempt it but to no purpose
1346,"In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head to began it.",in the next place i have no hop to make it keep no yeast to make it work no copper or kettle to make it boil and yet with all this thing want i verily believe have not the fright and terror i be in about the savage intervene i have undertake it and perhaps bring it to pass too for i seldom give anything over without accomplish it when once i have it in my head to begin it
1347,"But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of the monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and if possible save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.",but my invention now run quite another way for night and day i can think of nothing but how i may destroy some of the monster in their cruel bloody entertainment and if possible save the victim they should bring hither to destroy
1348,"It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more: but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?",it would take up a large volume than this whole work be intend to be to set down all the contrivance i hatch or rather brood upon in my thought for the destroy this creature or at little frighten them so a to prevent their come hither any much but all this be abortive nothing can be possible to take effect unless i be to be there to do it myself and what can one man do among them when perhaps there may be twenty or thirty of them together with their dart or their bow and arrow with which they can shoot a true to a mark a i can with my gun
1349,"Sometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all that was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them all.",sometimes i think if dig a hole under the place where they make their fire and putt in five or six pound of gunpowder which when they kindle their fire would consequently take fire and blow up all that be near it but a in the ï»¿1 place i should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them my store be now within the quantity of one barrel so neither can i be sure of its go off at any certain time when it may surprise them and at well that it would do little much than just blow the fire about their ear and fright them but not sufficient to make them forsake the place so i lay it aside and then propose that i would place myself in ambush in some convenient place with my three gun all double load and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them when i should be sure to kill or wind perhaps two or three at every shoot and then fall in upon them with my three pistol and my sword i make no doubt but that if there be twenty i should kill them all

1351,"I went so far with it in my imagination that I employed myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.",i go so far with it in my imagination that i employ myself several day to find out proper place to put myself in ambuscade a i say to watch for them and i go frequently to the place itself which be now grow much familiar to me but while my mind be thus fill with thought of revenge and a bloody putt twenty or thirty of them to the sword a i may call it the horror i have at the place and at the signal of the barbarous wretch devour one another abet my malice
1352,"Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot.",good at length i find a place in the side of the hill where i be satisfy i may securely wait till i see any of their boat come and may then even before they would be ready to come on shore convey myself unseen into some thicket of tree in one of which there be a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely and there i may sit and observe all their bloody doing and take my full aim at their head when they be so close together a that it would be next to impossible that i should miss my shoot or that i can fail wound three or four of them at the ï»¿1 shoot

1355,"After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach every way.",after i have thus lay the scheme of my design and in my imagination put it in practice i continually make my tour every morning to the top of the hill which be from my castle a i call it about three mile or much to see if i can observe any boat upon the sea come near the island or stand over towards it but i begin to tire of this hard duty after i have for two or three month constantly keep my watch but come always back without any discovery there have not in all that time be the little appearance not only on or near the shore but on the whole ocean so far a my eye or glass can reach every way

1357,"But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on, and to be as it were the executioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another.",but now when a i have say i begin to be weary of the fruitless excursion which i have make so long and so far every morning in vain so my opinion of the action itself begin to alter and i begin with cool and calm thought to consider what i be go to engage in what authority or call i have to pretend to be judge and executioner upon this man a criminal whom heaven have think fit for so many age to suffer unpunished to go on and to be a it be the executioner of his judgment one upon another how far this people be offender against me and what right i have to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they she would promiscuously upon one another

1361,"When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their arms and submitted.",when i consider this a little it follow necessarily that i be certainly in the wrong that this people be not murderer in the sense that i have before condemn them in my thought any much than that christians be murderer who often put to death the prisoner take in battle or much frequently upon many occasion put whole troop of man to the sword without give quarter though they throw down their arm and submit
